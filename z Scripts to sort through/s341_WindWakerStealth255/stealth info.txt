1. Set up constants in the script, as follows. Any which list a default will work fine at their default value.
BARREL_ITEM (must be manually set!): ID of the item which will be used to run the barrel item script
DRAW_LAYER (default 6): layer to draw the spotlight/npc line of sight on
DRAW_OPACITY (default OP_TRANS): the opacity to draw the line of sight/spotlight in
WARP_SFX (default 0): The SFX to play when warping.
WARP_FLAGS (default 0): The set of flags to use for WarpEx - use `WARP_FLAG_` constants from std.zh.
CAUGHT_SFX (default 0): The SFX to play when you are noticed

2. Set up the passive item script:
For the item you set to BARREL_ITEM,
Make sure `Equipment Item` is checked. The Item Class should be a `Custom ItemClass ##` class.
Under `Flags`, check `Constant Script`
Set an LTM, and create associated graphics, to make the hero look like he's walking while under a barrel.
Assign the "Action Script" as `barrelItem`
Set parameters-
D0: If 0, barrel can only be placed on walkable areas. Else, ignores solidity.
D1: If 0, all graphics are handled by the link tile modifier. If 1, the barrel combo will be drawn over link when he is hiding.
* Note: the walking tiles still need to be handled by the LTM.
Set QR- `ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Item Scripts Run for Multiple Frames` must be checked

3. Set up patrol enemies!
Place the enemy using an inherent enemy placement flag, on a path of placed flags (of any type, preferrably a scripted flag)
* Or, spawn the enemy using a script, on a placed path of flags (instead of using an inherent placement flag).
* * The included `ffc script enemyPlacement` can be used for this.
* It will follow these flags in a path, and if it sees Hero, it will play a cutscene of running towards him and then jail him.
* The enemy will ignore all solidity, to follow this path.
D0: The color to use to draw the line of sight. Use `0` for no drawing.
D1: DMap to warp to
D2: Screen to warp to
D3: Warp return square to use. 0-3 for A-D, -1 for pit warp
D4: Forward sight range, in pixels
D5: Forward sight angle (between 0 and 90, inclusive. 0/1 are tunnel vision, 89/90 are wide vision). Recommended: 45.
D6: If 0, will prefer clockwise movement at turns, else, counterclockwise.
D7: Flag to follow. If 0, uses placed flag being stood on. Reading `npc->InitD[7]` will tell you what flag is being used.

Enemy Editor data:
* Enemy type should be "Other"
* Step speed will be used for the movement
* Defenses should ALL be set to "Block", unless you want the guard to be killable of course.
* If you set it to be unkillable, be sure to set "Doesn't count as beatable enemy"
* Homing Factor / Halt Rate / Random Rate / Hunger are totally ignored.
* Damage will be forcibly set to 0. Weapon damage is unaffected.

Set QR: `ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Sprite Coordinates are Float` must be checked

4. Placing barrels
Place an FFC, and set the script to `hidableBarrel`.
Set the combo to look like a barrel, should look similar to the graphics used for your LTM.
...That's it. Barrel done.

5. Placing Spotlights
Place an FFC, and set the script to `spotlight`.
Set the combo to something invisible.
Set parameters:

D0: The color to use to draw the spotlight. Use `0` for no drawing.
D1: DMap to warp to
D2: Screen to warp to
D3: Warp return square to use. 0-3 for A-D, -1 for pit warp
D4: Radius of circle, from center of FFC, to be a spotlight.

Movement: You can set this up using default FFC movement, and changers. No scripted movement is provided.
