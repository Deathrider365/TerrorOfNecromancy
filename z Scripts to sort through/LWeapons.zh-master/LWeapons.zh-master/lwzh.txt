//Lweapons.zh Version 1.4.6

+-------+
| USAGE |
+-------+

Lweapons.zh is used to create lweapons independent of ffcs that can have a variety of behaviors.

A Lweapons.zh script should begin by calling one of the functions that launches the lweapons.
This sets up much of the lweapon's internal data. By calling UpdateLWZH1() before waitdraw and
UpdateLWZH2() in your global script, you activate the automatic handling of these lweapons. 

The global variables are used to set things such as flags for various behaviors,movement types,
the life of the lweapon, what it does on dying as well as important data for proper combo interaction.

Most lweapon attributes can be altered by these functions, to create a lweapon of the size and appearance
that you desire.

Most of the lweapons do not have to be of their intended type and when it comes to melee lweapons;
using the original type is impossible. The sprites for the lweapons should have at least three tiles,
in the order vertical, horizontal and diagonal.

There are a number of functions used to create and control lweapons. They
can be assigned a number of simple movements and can be made to vanish and
spawn additional lweapons. These behaviors require the weapons to be passed
into UpdateLWZH2() each frame.

To prevent conflicts with Lweapons.zh, scripts should avoid using the index
lweapon->Misc[LW_ZH_I_FLAGS]. This index is set to 15 by default, but that can be changed.

Functions, variables, and constants whose names start with __ are for internal
use and may be changed or removed in future versions without warning.

+--------+
| GLOBAL |
+--------+

These functions should be called in the active global script.

void UpdateLWZH1()
	*Call before Waitdraw()
	*Handles things like reactivating Link's collision detection.
	*Also, makes it where reflected lweapons don't hurt you.

void UpdateLWZH2()
	*Call after Waitdraw()
	*Handles all lweapon behaviors modified by the other scripts.
