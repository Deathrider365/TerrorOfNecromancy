Interitus = Decay
Vita = Life

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Opening Story (Video) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When creation began, the world was created by the three Goddesses; Din, Farore, and Nayru. What most don't know is that there is a fourth Goddess; Haeren. She is the Goddess of life, death, and rebirth. She governes the circle of life. The three Goddesses had their triforce protected by the Hylian Family passed down by the Goddess Hylia. However, Hylia did not see Haeren as a true Goddess and sealed her triforce in a Temple on a small landmass off of the island of Vita.

Over time the people of Vita began to devlop, but were still without any form of solid leadership, until a Hylian scholar, on an exploratory expedition, discovered the island. He took interest in the island and it's history, and eventually found himself in a leadership position.

Eventually he discovered the ancient, decripid temple and found Haeren's Triforce of Life. For years he studied the is, being near the top of the Hylian tree he had already studied the other three Triforce, so he wanted to explore this estranged fourth Triforce.

He became very close to the Triforce and eventually attempted to wield it. Being that he had near unchallenged control over the island he had a surge of power, and he reveled in it. So with the added power of the Triforce of Life, the power went to his head, and in that came darkness and greed. 

From there on he ruled the island with an iron fist, excercising the power of the Triforce. The Triforce that once shown as brightly as the others began to grow dark, twisted, corrupted, the power dominated his mind. Eventually he began to explore the powers of necromancy, abusing the power of rebirth and death, practicing on the peoples of the island.

<<<acknowledge the fact that the temple is on a small landmass off the coast of vita (interitus) and that after becoming the necromancer he acknowlegded the significance between triforce and their respecitve temples he returned to the small landmass and left the temple to rubble (make the entrance ruined and it also explains the dead trees around the entrance)>>>

Many years past and the scholar became known as the Necromancer. His dark influence began to spread throughout the island giving it the name of Interitus.

Eventually the Hylian government recieved word of a disturbance on the island, and the Hylian King sends Link and Zelda to investigate, being that Ganon had been banished to the Sacred Realm.

On their way to the island they encounter a beast known as the Leviathan...

<Have boss text for the Leviathan>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game opens with a fight with the Leviathan on the ship they are taking, Link has all of the typical end game gear
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<Link fails to defeat the Leviathan and it destroys their ship, link wakes on a beach with only his small shield>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The island he washes up on is the island from ToN mini. He wanders the island until he finds a ruined shrine, which speaks to him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Link, you have arrived. I have been waiting for you. You are the hero that saved the Triforce of Din, Farore, and Nayru and vanquished Ganon. I must now ask of you to save my Triforce from the one who corrupted it, the Necromancer of Interitus. I cannot help you until my temple is rid of the darkness from the corruption of my Triforce. Once you cleanse my temple, the portal to Interitus will be clear of the darkness and you will be able to help the island be rid of that foul man."

"Ah, you have arrived Link. It seems my Leviathan was unable to claim you, no surprise given your reputation. The princess? 
My soldiers found her washed up on shore after your unfortunate accident. Do not worry, I have already stripped her of her 
Triforce of Wisdom and put her somewhere where she will be safe. Oh, I also possess the Triforce of Power, it was recovered 
from the wreckage of your ship. I do not expect you to give your Triforce of Courage freely, so I shall pry it from your corpse, 
which I will then use as as one of my most prized thralls!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Link fights the Necromancer which obviously is an unwinnable fight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"I hope you did not expect to win this fight, that wooden equpiment doesn't quite cut it does it? It matters not, I shall take your Triforce."

<The Necromancer takes the Triforce from Link>

"Hu, I did not think I could posses the feeling known as pity. Seeing you lay there all pathetic, almost a shame to destroy you. How about this, I will give my Leviathan another chance. I shall throw you to the sea and let him claim you, have fun!"

<The Necromancer throw Link back into the water, at the mercy of the Leviathan. But almost immidiately after, a small canoe piloted by an old man picks him up. He takes Link to his shake down the coast>

<Link wakes up>

"I see you are awake, I feared that you were lost. I know who you are Link, you are the hero that saved Hyrule numerous times. I see the Necromancer extracted the Triforce of Courage from you, that is unfortunate. I have heard word that he already posses 3 of the 4 triforce, all he needs to do is find Zelda and he will wreck havoc on entire world. Link, you must find Zelda, and collect all 4 Triforce before he can. I hear he split each Triforce into 3 fragments to prevent you from obtaining them. I managed to find the equipment you lost after your duel with the Necromancer, they are in the chest behind me. Good luck Link!"

<Link enters the boss room and encounters the Necromancer>

"My my my, Link. How far you have come. And look at that! You have nearly fully assembled all of the Triforces. Unfortuantely, your journey comes to an end. You are no longer necessary to my plans. Also, I have found an old buddy of yours that would like to catchup with you. He was known to you as Ganon, but Ganon was but an insignificant, arrogant swine. All he wanted was the power of the Triforce to conquer the world. He was short sighted, he did not look past his puny ambitions. He did not think outside of the box. With the Triforce of Death, there is far more that can be done. Although, I am not so arrogant as to reveal my plans, that is such a stupid villan thing to do. But what I will tell you is that I have made Ganon what he could have been; an actual threat. Before, he could be slain by arrows fasioned out of a shiny metal, how pathetic. I have infused him with my necromancy power, Silver Arrows are useless against him, he is now PURE DARKNESS!! I suppose it will be nice for him to finally destroy the Savior of Hyrule and the bane of his banishment. GANON, ARISE!!!

<Ganon rising like how Nightmare from Fusion rose>

"GANON, DESTROY!!"

<You fight Undead Ganon and win obviously since you have the Light Arrows, upon his final death>

"What?! How dare you find something here that can slay one of my greatest creations!! Oh the graification would have been sweet as well. No matter. Once insignificant always insignificant. I fear not your quest to obtain all of the Triforce, I suppose you do have some usefullness left in you."

<You proceed to the Triforce room to find the Triforce, upon grabbing it you are ambushed by cloaked figures>

<Screen goes black, the it is revealed you are in Zelda's Hideout>

"Link, are you alright? I hope they did not harm you as they got you out of <Level 11, use its name here>."

<Animation reveals that the Cloaked Zelda is Zelda>

"It is alright Link, I am fine. After we were attacked by the Leviathan I woke up in a dungeon and my Triforce was gone. But luckily the the good people of Interitus rescued me and I helped them construct a new hideout. Their original one was found by the Necromencer's forces. I also filled them in on everything going on and who we are. I see you have reclaimed all but 2 of the Triforce of Death;s fragments, the people here informed me about the Triforce of Death and how it has enabled the Necromancer to bring back the dead. They say the only way to stop him is to destroy the evil triforce! So Link, we must find the last fragments and..."

<Voice of that old man that saved you after Leviathan>

"No!  It cannot be destroyed. The Triforce of Death is not all it is. It was once the Triforce of Life before the corrupt heart of Naamen. Naamen is what he was once called before he became corrupted by the Triforce of Death. How do I know all of this? I came to this island during the expedition that was led by Naamen, I managed to stay out of his way as he made a plaything out of this land. But we never forgot what he did and what the Triforce of Life is. Link, to stop him you must cleanse the Triforce of Life by bringing it to the Shrine of Haeren. One problem is, I have no idea where it is. This land only has the shrines of the other three goddesses."

<Voice of Zelda>

"So we must find this Shrine of Haeren, I have no idea where that is as well, do you Link? Well I suppose it doesn't matter yet. We shall search for this shrine while you collect the rest of the fragments, good luck all of us!"

<You go to the Shrine of Nayru for Nayru's Love and Scholar's Mind>

<You head back to the hideout to tell them you have the fragments and you know that the shrine of Haeren is on the Island of Haeren and you know where the portal to get there is. But when you get to the hideout, it is destroyed, you explore the rubble, only to find a gaping hole in the back of it, you go in>

"Ahh Link. Wow, it took you only THAT much time to retrieve the last 2 fragments of the Triforce of Death eh? Well, you are indeed a freak of nature to be able to run through ALL of my minions and to do it so easily. As impressive as you are you are, your compulsiveness to go around collecting pieces of extremely power artifacts and bringing them to one place makes me question how smart you really are. You retrieved all of the fragments of Haeren's Triforce, just, for, me. Yea yea yea I know I sound like a generic arrogant villan who thinks he already won. But the thing is, I have. Oh yes it would be so simple to go to the Shrine of Haeren and cleanse this Triforce and have a happily ever after. But you see that wont happen."

<He proceeds to kill Zelda and the rest of the innocent civilians>

"Zelda is dead, that wreched old man is dead, all that you trusted is dead. It is only you, me, and my whole army of the undead!"

<You become surrounded as he makes all he killed including zelda, undead thralls>

"I honestly do not think you can squirm your way out of this. I will take your Triforce of Death fragments, those other 3 Triforce are useless, all I want are those fragments Link, hand them over."

<You do>

"Finally you come to your senses Link and actually do something the easy way, although I suppose in the past you always did things the hard way and succeeded so I suppose I should be flattered you felt helpless to me. Goodbye Link, I am off to the Shrine of Haeren, and please do keep your undead princess and friends company, they have missed you spending those brief moments in Hell."

<He warps out, and you are forced to flee, fighting your way out but you cant kill any of them, make them swarm you and you walk slowly out of the cave and eventually escape>

<Once out, you b-line to the portal to the Island of Haeren>

<Once on the island you make your way to the shrine and attempt to stop the Necromancer>

"Honestly I am not surprised by you anymore Link. Although I hope you enjoyed slashing you sword at your dear friends, I am sure they appreciated that. You know how when the Goddesses left this world they imbued the Triforces with their power, leaving the Triforces as their..."

<Link throws his boomerang at him in rage, missing him>

"HO ho ho temper temper. As I was saying, they left their Triforces as their only presence on this world, and went to Heavens. Have you ever wondered where EXACTLY they went? They went to the core of creation, the infinite void of incomprehensible power, the power that created them! I shall join them. By purging this Triforce of any life it may yet possess, I shall have more of an influence on it than that of its creator! I shall become a literal GOD, and RISE to the VOID OF CREATION!! I SHALL BE KNOWN AS, APOPHIS, GOD OF DEATH!!! Now, I assume you wish to have one of your classic 'fight before the bad guy can do his thing' fight. I suppose it would be fitting that the last thing I do on this plane of existance is destroy the last remaining hope this world has."

<This is the Final Boss, if you die here, just for the first death, there will be a cutscene of him doing what he said just before the game over, subsequent deaths will not show this cutscene>

<You beat him and the game ends with the credits, Minidungeon 8 is unlocked after and the Main Dungeon of the post game begins>

"How.....how could you defeat me? This isn't possible! I knew you were powerful, but you are still just a child!"

<Your 3 Triforces glow brightly>

"Those wretched Goddesses! This will not last 'hero'! If you cleanse that triforce you have no idea what you will release! This island has a history, a very dark history, and by cleansing the Triforce of Death you will release them. HAHAHAH....uhng......AAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!"

<He explodes and dies>

<There is a cutscene of you taking the Triforce of Death to the Shrine of Haeren and it gets cleansed. The island becomes cleansed of all that the Necromancer wroght>

<Upon cleansing the triforce Haeren speaks to Link>

"Link, you have cleansed my Triforce and have saved Vita. Vita? That is what this land was once known as, in some tongues it means Life. Ever since the Necromancer claimed the island it was referred to as Interitus, meaning Decay. With the Triforce of Life in hand you will be able to undo all of the damage done by the Triforce of Death."

<Link heads back to where Zelda and friends were killed, raises up the Triforce of Life and everyone gets better>

"Link? What happened Link? Have you destroyed the Necromancer? I no longer have this sense of dread. The Triforce! It is no longer dark! You cleansed it! We must cleanse this island Link! Then, we may return home!

<The credits roll and the scenes playing behind the credits is Link and Zelda cleansing the island with the Triforce of Life>

<The credits show them getting on a repaired ship and sailing home>

<The final scene in the credits is a scene of that tomb that Zelda was being held in, there is a door in that tomb that lights up, screen goes black>

"You have completed The Terror of Necromancy, Sound Test is available and you may play it on Paladin Mode"

<returns you to the starting screen>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Post Game ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<So basically The Necromancer, after corrupting the Triforce, he encountered the Undead Legion and sealed them with the power of the Triforce of Death, since Link cleansed it the seal was broken. The Necromancer sealed them because even he feared them. You can find a book that the Necromancer wrote explaining this information>

<Post Game begins. You reload your game your game and it takes you to the starting screen>

<At this point you have the Triforce of Life, return to the Shrine of Haeren and obtain Haeren's Grace and Death's Touch>

<With all 4 completed Triforce return to the Holy Shrine that I made somewhere in the game, a door will have been opened>

<The door leads down a secret walkway, you come to a room with 6 Chests, each containing a Holy equipment piece>

<Upon opening each chest you are greeted by dialogue explaining it (adds drama and meaning)>

<At the top center of the room there is a tablet that reads...>

"The way of the Paladin is a riteous one. The War for Light is neverending, for the Undead Legion is everywhere, nearly impossible to completely vanquish. To ye who reads this tablet, if you be worthy, claim the Arms and Armor of the Paladin, and Keep the Undead Legion at bay."

<You open all of the chests, giving the Holy Sword, Holy Mail, Holy Boomerang, Holy Hammer, Holy Arrows, Holy Shield>

<The tomb that the Necromancer locked Zelda up in is the largest tomb in the graveyard, this is what opens up when the helmet and all 20 rings are palaced, it is the main dungeon of the post game>

<You head to the door in the Tomb where Zelda was held, if you fifill the requirements it will open when you enter that room>

<This fight is significantly harder, you have, perhaps the leader of the Undead Legion there as well>

<Beating the final boss here gives the quest password or something cool idk>

<The game saves there>
