//~~~~~ Prologue ~~~~~//
   In ancient times unknown, there was a thriving kingdom on the island of Vita, named after the purity of life granted by the goddess Haeren. With the Triforce of Life she had full 
control over life and death, making life on the island a near paradise by her graces. The lord of the kingdom was intelligent and mindful, always making the best decisions for the 
kingdom. However, he coveted the power that Haeren controled and soon hatched a plan to seize her power for himself.

   He ordered the Brigadier of his Legion of Knights, Aemulor, and his legion to capture Hearen's Triforce and take over the island, and eventually vanquish Haeren. 
With the cunningness of Aemulor, he led his legion to victory, capturing the Triforce from the goddess, and hid it deep within a remote hidden base.
Almost immediately her power started to drain, as the Triforce, being in the hands of those with such darkness, was tainting the purity of the Triforce. 
She, along with the good people of the island, pleaded to the king to find the unknown thieves, and return the Triforce. He agreed, and with many of his guards he sent her on a wild 
goose chase, to give him time to spend on learning the power of the Triforce.

   Not long soon after, given that Aemulor's main task was keeping the Triforce hidden, and the king spending much of his time managing the kingdom, gave rise to an unprecedented 
opportunity to Aemulor. In his time guarding the Triforce he learned far more than the king did, and began practicing the powers it granted, learning what would eventually be coined 
as "Necromancy". Taking those that already had passed on and reviving them in darkness, resulting in a twisted demonic shade of the original being. It did not take the king long to 
see that Aemulor was far more knowledgeable with the power of the Triforce. Despite Aemulor swearing complete allegience to the king, the king was uneasy with the situation. 

   Eventually Aemulor became so attuned to the power of the Triforce that he was able to sense materials on the island of Vita that could reveal the life force of living beings, 
which would give him a better grasp of their being for ease of manipulation. As a result he ordered one of his Colonels, Servus Malus, to scour the island in search of the rare 
material. Unfortunately for him there was only one reliable source, in the Krahzen mountains on the northern coast of Vita. As it was a rare material, not much was found and the 
material was not one that was easily molded, not even Aemulor could mutate it. Therefore he captured the best smiths on the island, a small family that had already made most of the 
island's weapons and armor, to work with it. They succedded in mutating it, giving Aemulor the ability to create talismens that could reveal to him the lifeforce of most living things 
around him.

   It was time to make a move, Aemulor's power had peaked, being able to effortlessly exert his intentions on nearly any living and non living being on Vita, it was time to seize 
the kingdom and overthrow the king. The king, already having suspicion that Aemulor would attempt a coup, was ready and had his castle fortified to the highest degree. During the siege, 
the king could see his soldiers stood no chance, as not only was Aemulor powerful, but he enhanced his legion. Bearing new armor and weapons infused with darkness under the name Undead 
Legion, as they were all enhanced living dead soldiers that could not die unless Aemulor deemed it so. The skirmish was swift, as Aemulor was able to control all of the king's fallen 
soldiers during the battle, increasing his numbers. Desperate, the king fled to Haeren, who had grown so weak from her Triforce not only being stolen, but corrupted. The king revealed 
his intentions led by jealosy, but vowed to reclaim her Triforce in her name. She was unable to assist, as she had never known humans to claim a Triforce and command it with such 
ferocity and accuracy.

   Haeren was powerless, only the other goddesses themselves could stop the coming apocalypse of the newly titled Necromancer Aemulor. Eventually the goddesses did come to the aid of 
the isolated island, and were able to contain Aemulor to the island of Vita. After a ferocious war that nearly obliterated the island, the goddesses were able to separate the Triforce 
from Aemulor, and removed it from the island, quickly draining Aemulor's power. The goddesses created a remote island that could not be sailed to by normal ships, one that was hidden 
in the middle of the ocean, and erected a temple designed to prevent anyone from claiming the Triforce and risking another global apocalypse. Unfortunately as her Triforce was mutated 
by Aemulor only a hero with a pure heart could cleanse it, resulting in Haeren herself diminishing before the eyes of the golden goddesses, barely able to communicate with the living 
plane. Simultaneously, Aemulor's power had also weakened greatly, the power he once controlled took a toll on his physical form, causing him and his forces to deteriorate. However, 
their spirits were volatile and resiliant and would not leave the land, resulting in a dark corrupted blemish on the once beautiful island.

   The king, still king of Vita, swore to never again tamper with forces of the gods, isolating the dark side of the island and living out the rest of his days paranoid that he may 
see the dark arts performed once again. The war against Aemulor left the island in an irrepairable state, forever tainting the land. As a result the island was known as the island 
of Interitus.

   Ages passed, the king's decendents slowly found themselves unable to properly rule the land, resulting in a power vacuum that would be taken advantage of by residents that shared 
some of the darkness permanently left being by the Necromancer Aemulor and his Undead Legion. Dark spirits roamed the lands, causing minor infractions amongst the people who were 
losing grace left behind by Haeren. The events unfolding on Hyrule, slowly found their way to Interitus through the occassional sailing passerby visiting the forsaken land. Talk of 
heroes saving lands from evil circulated around the residents who so desperately needed a hero to return order and peace to their home, leading many to pray for such an adventurer 
would arrive... only to be disappointed. The Legend of the Calamity of Vita became the mythos of the people of Interitus, the time the island was nearly destroyed by a once powerful 
evil that could topple gods and control life and death. So did the once worshipped shining silver Triforce of Hearen, of which, like the goddess, faded out of legend only to be 
vaguely referenced in ancient forgotten texts.
\\~~~~~ Prologue ~~~~~\\
//=========================================================================================================================================================================================//
\\~~~~~ The Scholar ~~~~~\\
   Upon Link's eventual defeat of Ganon, 7 years after Ganon had abused the power of the Triforce of Power and taken over Hyrule, peace returned and would be rebuild from the tyranny 
of the dark lord.It was at this time that a Hylian scholar who had been studying the Triforces of the three golden goddesses wanted to venture out and see the world. Perhaps it was the 
passing of the ages, or the evils of the world fading into obscurity, or even dumb luck that the impenetrable barrier sealing the Isle of Haeren had faded, and in the travels of the 
Hylian scholar the island was discovered. The scholar, with his sizable platoon, investigated the ancient decrepit island. There was a neutral but uneasy feeling to the island, like 
something lay sleeping waiting to be reawakened inside. The potency of the power that once coursed through the Triforce made it almost hypnotic to humans, and could very easily corrupt 
their hearts. Eventually the scholar, fighting through ancient ruined traps and grotesque monsters unlike that which they have ever seen, found the temple's antechamber chamber. 
   Upon entering he encountered a slumbering undead; An ancient hero chosen by Haeren, of whom she thought had a pure enough heart to restore the light within her Triforce. He had 
succumbed to the Triforce, and performed dark arts in the temple, even being able to use the darkness to summon ancient souls onto the island, most notable the soul of a member of the 
Undead Legion which acted as his personal guard. Unable to leave the encased island by the power of the golden three, knew that like himself, Haeren would attempt to summon another 
unsuspecting hero to cleanse the triforce. Over the ages he fell into a deep sleep inside the antechamber of the temple. Luckily for the scholar he was able to acquire the Triforce 
under the negligence of the ancient undead, escaping the island with an unexpected treasure. Returning to his ship he began his enthusiastic studies on the dark Triforce, as it was 
unheard of that there was a fouth one in existence. 

   In time the expedition found the Island of Interitus. Hyrule was aware of the lands of Interitus, but not much of it's history and status. The Hylians were welcomed with open arms, 
as the people and recent generationshave not known any symbols of authority or security. They pleaded with the soldiers to retake the ancient castle that once was the symbol of strength 
and prosperity of Interitus. No more than a year later and the soldiers claimed the castle, as well as the various towers around the island to establish order, and snuff out any brigands 
and criminals. During this time of establishing order that the good soldiers of Hyrule enacted, gave the scholar a lot of time to get very familiar with the dark Triforce, but he could 
not seem to make anything of it. It layed dormant, like something or someone was holding the door shut, not allowing him in. He felt there had to be something on the island that could 
potentially awaken the Triforce given its close history with the island. He explored, ventured into the island following the feeling of dread left behind on the island with a small 
platoon of soldiers, as well as his adopted son Daserta. Daserta was an orphan that the scholar had mentored on hyrule, about the same age as Link, whom he had serving as his right 
hand, man.

   In their time following this unknown darkness, they came accross a secluded portion of the island that writhed with the darkness the scholar had been following. Clutching the darkened 
Triforce in hishands, he entered the darkness. He found a treasure trove of artifacts forign to the scholar, ancient texts describing things that he had never heard of; 'necromancy'. Soon 
after poking through somedocuments, the Triforce bursted from his grip filling the whole area with the darkness. As if a bomb went off, the Triforce reacted violently with the area around 
them. The darkness filled those present, like leeches grasping onto a host. After regaining their conciousness, the company left the ruins unsure of what happened and unaware of what they 
set in motion. Not long after returning to their home in the castle, the scholar was able to interact with the Triforce in ways he was not expecting, not only was the Triforce reacting to 
his will but it seemed to feel natural. He felt powerful, nothing like he felt with the other Triforces. Quickly he started playing around with his newfound powers. One night he summoned 
all that was in the company that led the expedition into the ruins. They all had felt the power of the Triforce, they all felt the connected darkness they had awakened. That night was plan 
to take full control over the island of Interitus was made. 

   What followed was the making of history repeating itself. The scholar gives out his plans to his soldiers that they are to take full control over the island, and eliminate all that 
oppose by force. Many of the soldiers refused, as it went against their directive of exploring new lands and helping anyone in need. Those that opposed were either executed or fled the 
castle. Those that stayed were granted power by the Necromancer. With the new threat the Scholar presented, the soldiers that defected from the Scholar setup posts in the towns of 
Interitus. They trained who they could to aid in the defense of the innocent, and readied for any incoming attacks. The Scholar had spent enough time with the Triforce to nearly 
efforlessly control the being around him, claiming the ancient title of Necromancer he had read in the texts of old. Daserta, serving ever still as the Necromancer's right hand, could 
sense the darkness growing within the man that had shown him kindness, but could not defy him as thoughts of such made him guilty and afraid to go against his wishes.

   With the Necromancer's power growing, and the power of Aemulor slowly reawakening, members of Aemulor's Undead Legion begin to rise up, as they heard their master's call through the 
Triforce of Death. The Necromancer, controlling them, orders his new legionnaires to train his most elite hylian guards in the combative ways of the ancient legion. After word of this 
Necromancer spread around the island, a messenger was sent back to Hyrule to inform the Hyrulian government that a grave threat is growing on the Island of Interitus that could potentially 
pose a threat to the world. As a result Link and Zelda were sent out, having defeated Ganon and controlling the power of the golden Triforces, to stop the terror caused by the Necromancer's 
terrible necromancy.
\\~~~~~ The Scholar ~~~~~\\
//=========================================================================================================================================================================================//
<<<GAME BEGINS>>>
   
   As Link and Zelda sail for the island now known as Interitus, they are encountered by a massive sea serpent known to legend as the Leviathan. They commence battle, eventually resulting 
in the Leviathan destroying their ship, sending all on board into the seas around Interitus. With the waning power of Haeren, she influenced Link's arrival on her secluded island. She 
explained that Link is the only one who could fix all that happened ages ago. That he could restore the light in her Triforce by returning the Triforce to her temple and with his pure 
heart, restoring the light within purging the evil that claimed it. However first, he would need to purge the darkness plaguing the temple.

<Mini Dungeon 1: Temple of Haeren>
~Amalgamation of Decay: ---Shambles---~
   Link defeats a powerful undead residing within the temple. The arrival of Link on the island as a result of Haeren's intervention awoke the ancient failed hero residing within the temple. 
He knew as he predicted that the goddess would indeed summon a successor to him, which he could use to potentially escape the island. Shocking to him however, his source of power had been 
removed, reducing his powers substantially but given the dark Triforce still held the potent darkness, was able to maintain control of his raised undead and called them into action and to 
take down this new hero.
   After defeating the shambled evil, Haeren gives Link means to leave the island in a raft left behind by the ancient fallen hero. She wishes Link success in his journey as he sails off to 
Interitus. While sailing to Interitus, he is encountered by the Leviathan once again who informs him that going to the island of Interitus is exactly what the Necromancer wants, as he and 
Zelda possess the other three Triforce, of which the Necromancer could combine the powers to become the most powerful god to ever exist. The Leviathan once again attacks Link with a massive 
tidal wave, but with the last of her power Haeren protects Link, and saftely gets him to Interitus. Link wakes up in a teepee on the eastern coast of Interitus, greeted by an old man who 
informs him of the situation on the island. The old man has knowledge of the events on Hyrule, as well as much of the recent history of Interitus, giving him great insight. He even informs 
Link that the Triforce that came with He and Zelda were lost to the Necromancer's forces. Where the old man doesnt know directly how to help Link with his goal of stopping the Necromancer, 
he gives him guidance and peace of mind. He informs Link that it would be wise to start in the forest to the north of the nearby village of Viridi, as it has seen some supernatural events 
taking place and could be a good place to start. The old man also expresses confusion of why the Necromancer would split up his triforce.
   the Necromancer, under the control of Aemulor through the Triforce, was made to split them up in hopes that Link would be more powerful than the Scholar, giving Aemulor potential for a
stronger host.
   After exploring around the nearby areas of the northeastern side of the island and talking with the locals, Link learns that one of the Necromancer's minions has awakened an ancient beast 
in a lair found deep within the Cumpura Forest. The ancient beast is known as the Hazarond, a monster that thrives in natural oils, and has the ability to breath fire to ignite the oils it
excretes as a self defense mechanism. With one of Aemulor's many expeditions for the materials that grant the ability to sense the life force within beings, he came across this already ancient
lair, and deemed it not worth the trouble, as even he did not want to discover it's wrath, as the oil-fire combination could cause untold damage to his forces, as they were all undead and 
highly flammable.

<<Level 1 - Pernicious Grotto>>
~Source of Corruption: ---Hazarond---~

   Link investigates the lair and learns of the Necromancer's follower that ventured into the grotto, learning more about the Hazarond, until he learns that the follow had be claimed by 
the ancient beast upon defeating it. Link claims a shard of his Triforce of Courage within the grotto. Word gets around through the Necromancer's soldiers that as expected, Link and 
Zelda have arrived on the island, and Link has claimed one of the Triforce shards.

<Battle Arena 1: Raccoon Hollow>
~Gargantuan Bandit of the Forest ---Overgrown Racoon---~ 

   Link ventures around more of the island and finds himself in the company of highly intelligent racoons. It is said in few obfuscated texts that with the grace of some ancient magic, 
even the animals were able to communicate with the peoples of Interitus. While mostly confused, Link encounteres a guard that was once in the higher circles of the Necromancer's ranks, 
and hears of what the Necromancer was involved with. Hushed tones about something big, something even the Necromancer himself was wary of. Eventually, Link encounters a concerned father 
outside of an ancient abandoned mine. His son went into the mine to practice his archery on the Keese within, but with the Father having hurt himself, tasks Link to take his lantern 
and get his son out. 

<<Level 2: Derelict Quarry>>
~Colonel of Darkness ---Servus Malus---~

   Link finds the father's son, who gifts Link with his bow as well as the knowledge of a determined soldier, saying something about going deeper into the mine to take care of some 
long overdue business. Link finds his way  into the depths of the mine and walks in on that soldier, yelling in an open room, accusing some being of mistreating his descendent. A spector 
reveals itself, the cursed spirit of Servus Malus, high ranking Colonel of Aemulor,  tasked to find one of the rarest resources on the island. Outside of the control of the Colonel, 
the material was tapped in the Krahzen mountains making Servus unable to deliver what Aemulor wanted. As a result of the failure,  he and all of his remaining miners were cursed by 
Aemulor to forever roam the tunnels of the mine never to have peace. Servus, still seething at this failure taunts the soldier. Seemingly proud of his cruelty and mistreatment of the 
miners that had failed him, he slanders the soldier's descendent, degrading him to ants digging insignificant tunnels. Link intervenes after Servus launches the soldier across the room 
with ease, incapacitating him.  Link and Servus battle. After successfully weakening Servus, as he cannot truly be banished being bound to the power of Aemulor, he vanishes. Link talks 
to the injured solder, learning that he is a descendent of one of the miners that were present on the islands centuries ago, and he only went on the expedition with the scholar because 
he felt it was the best opportunity to get out of Hyrule and possibly find Interitus.

   It is heard amonst the guards in the Necromancer's castle that Link defeated an ancient Undead Legion Colonel. The guards know little of the Undead Legion of Aemulor, as the Necromancer 
has kept much of the original history locked up in his study. They express minor concern that Link is already gaining a lot of power, and that the Necromancer should be informed. 
Later, Link finds a remote house near the mines occupied by the family of the Father  and Son as well as the soldier. The Son found the soldier wandering out of the mine injured, and 
took him back to their house for rest. Link learns that the family living in the house are also decended from one of the miners that  mined during the Calamity of Vita, and after 
finding out that the soldier is also a descendent, agreed to let him rest in their house, and trade tales of their lineage. The soldier informs Link that since Link helped him battle 
Servus, he would aid Link on his quest as needed once he recovers. The soldier also tells Link that he was stationed at the guard tower outside of Viridi village, and was told to 
attack the village. He, not sypathetic to the Necromancer, gives  Link a key into the tower and tells him he should stop their plans before they wipe out the village. Wiping out the 
village would give the Necromancer a significant advantage, as he knows any Hyrulian aid would come from the east.

<Mini Dungeon 2: Seized Guardtower>
~Major of the Tower ---Asseclan---~
   
   Along the way up the tower, Link encounters a soldier locked up in the barracks. He tells Link that he does not sypathise with the Necromancer. Link, unlocking the door, set him 
free where he flees to Viridi village to rest and hide (he ends up in the main barracks building where you got the Cumpura Key. Eventually, Link reaches the summit where the leader of the 
tower resides. Asseclan is a Major of the Necromancer, a soldier that was given additional privilege by the Necromancer, learning combat from a Legionnaire. Upon defeating the elite guard, 
Link finds a signet with the Hylian symbol on it, which belonged to the soldier locked up in the tower. The elite guard's intention was to use the signet to infiltrate the non corrupt 
soldiers' hideouts with surprise attacks. It is a symbol of opposition to the Necromancer, proving allegiance to Hyrule and not the Necromancer. Through adventuring Link finds a hidden 
tunnel near the center of the northeastern plains that takes him to a ruined house in the desert storm plagued village of Auri. The tunnel was dug by a cultist to give easier access to the 
Shrine of Egentem.
   Link finds Auri is mostly locked off, given the unending storm's rage. He does however find some residents open to letting him inside. One resident being the mayor of the village, 
concerned for his village, pleads with Link to help. He suspects what could be the cause of the storms could be from a curse he read about in books from Auri Library, a library containing 
most of Interitus's remaining written history. The curse being that there is evil in the ruins the well was built to cover and attempting to enter them could reawaken an evil that would 
engulf their village in an unending storm, and he wants Link to go down there and vanquish the evil. 
   Back during the age of Aemulor's reign, he had an outpost in modern day Auri village, and used it as a watch tower to keep an eye on the border between the northern and southern 
regions of the island. During the Calamity of Vita, the tower was destroyed, and layed in ruin as most of the soldiers, including another one of his Colonels, was buried in sand. As the 
ages passed, Auri was constructed, and a well was placed intentionally over the buried ruins in an attempt to prevent anyone from reentering the ruins. 

   The mayor speaks of a resident in Auri that had knowledge on the curse and how to enter the well. The resident was odd to say the least, spent very little time in the village, always 
in his house and muttering frantically to himself. One day this resident gave the mayor a key to his house, and told him to save it for an adventurer. This resident is a member of the 
Cult of Egentem, led by a crazed "mage". The reason this resident was rarely seen by those in his village was because he often took his secret tunnel to the plains to get to the 
Shrine of Egentem to hear the word of the "mage".
   The shrine was originally called the Shrine of Aemulor, the place of worship for the original Necromancer Aemulor that orchestrated the Calamity of Vita. As the ages proceeded the 
shrine became overgrown with vegetation, and to the current inhabitants of the island it is just known as a place of darkness, presumed to be a remnant from the legend of the Calamity. 
It wasn't until "Egentem the Reborn" claimed it after his transformation and used it's dark presense as his stronghold and place to spread his knowledge to the cult he founded.
   The mayor gives Link the key to the resident's house. Link eventually finds the resident, dead. Turns out he died in his secret tunnel to Dodongos, and was revived from the 
Necromancer. He gives Link little information about himself, extatic that he is dead as that makes him a chosen follower of "Egentem the Reborn", and gives Link his Ocarina, as it is 
needed to enter the Shrine of Egentem, and he does not need to ocarina to enter given he is undead. Those who are living can only enter the shrine using the tune. On Link's way to the 
Shrine of Egentem, he finds the small village of Silva guarded by non corrupt hylian soldiers which allows him into the village, given he has the signet of allegiance. Link learns that 
the village is near the front lines of where the Necromancer's forces come from down south, and express concern for the village. The guards there express their direness towards the 
Necromancer forces coming very close to the village, and ask Link to end the Necromancer. Link finds himself at the Shrine of Egentem, where he meets a cultist frantically 
wanting to get into the shrine and does not have anyway to play the tune. Link plays the tune and enters the shrine with the cultist.

<<Level 3: Shrine of Egentem>>
~Cult Patriarch ---Egentem---~

   Upon reaching the main chamber of the shrine the cultist outside the entrance reveals himself to be the cult leader Egentem. He knew Link would would arrive at his shrine, as word 
traveled fast of Link's arrival and journey thus far, and would want the triforce shard he possesses. During the battle it can be clearly seen that this "mage" does not do anything with
magic. As it turns out, despite Egentem's claims of being reborn in darkness, he possesses no necromancy. They battle and Link is victorious.
   Egentem is a man convinsed that he is the ancient evil from the Legend of the Calamity of Vita reborn, and the Necromancer is a deciever. He is seen as a normal man in full body robes, 
but underneath he is actually undead, and the reason for his robes is that he cannot be in sunlight. He is the product of some of the Necromancer's early experimentation with the triforce. 
He was a normal man captured, killed, and brought back with the triforce, but remembers the experience as having a near death experience where an ancient evil saved him from eternal torment 
and believes he is the chosen one. He is known throughout the cult that he is undead, and the only reason he could be living is through the power of the ancient evil. His only power is his
abilities with physical combat, wielding a shield and a hammer.
   Upon leaving the Shrine, a guard is standing outside of the shrine and speaks to Link urgently saying he found out where zelda is, and she was captured by the Necromancer's forces, 
held in the in the guardtower's dungeon outside Viridi. Link asks to see his signet of allegiance but the guard insists the situation is too dire for such trinkets. Upon getting to 
the tower and into the dungeon, Link is ambushed by a bunch of the Necromancer's forces, including the soldier that led him there. Their intention was not to kill Link, but rather keep
him detained until the necromancer could arrive. At this point Link has 2 options; Wait in the cell for the necromancer to arrive or attempt a jail break, either scenario ends in him
captured, but the jail break one give some additional dialogue with the necromancer where he gives link an "option" of joining him willingly, in which case if Link says yes the
necromancer basically ignores Link knowing he would not go willingly. 
   Unfortunately for the Necromancer his plans happened out of order. His plan was to capture Zelda and use her to convinse Link to join his cause, but his forces have still yet to find Zelda. 
The Necromancer would like to still leverage the might of Link, but worries that if he doesnt kill him then there is a good change he could escape. 
   Eventually, while Link is locked up in the dungeons, the Necromancer's Right Hand visits and speaks to Link. He explains who he is and his concerns for the Scholar, he wants to 
help Link escape but cannot be seen helping. He quickly opens Link's cell and tells him to escape through a weak wall that he uses to leave discretely. Unbenownst to anyone, he leaves
the castle occassionally to help various Hylian soldiers by giving them insight to the Necromancer's plans.

<Battle Arena 2: Reformed Pirate Cave>
~Skeletal Pirate General --- ---~ 
   Link finds that the cave that is connected to the Necromancer's dungeon leads to the home of many undead pirates that do not appear to be hostile, but rather extremely passive. Upon
speaking to them Link learns that they were once a part of a crew of an ancient pirate lord that heard tell of a Jewel on Vita that would allow them to rule the seas by controlling the waves.
Speaking with the pirates Link learns that they were defeated by Aemulor, and were never able to recover the Jewel. One of the pirates mentions that they thought it was once in the marsh
lands on the eastern coast of Vita, but were never able to traverse it as it was not worth attempting to enter given the curse that lied upon it, as well as just being generally dangerous.
As Link exits the cave he finds himself at the village of Celo, as Right Hand recommended. He finds that the villagers are experiencing issue with nightly raids from undead pirates, part of
the same crew as Link met just moments ago. The villagers do not know why the pirates raid, but the reason is they suspect the Jewel is in the direction of the village, as they have the magic
from Lenses of Truth at their disposal, and when peering in their lenses they can see a fogginess in the direction of Celo. These pirates are not typical pirates, they are knowledgeable of
magic and have special Lenses that do more than simply show the hidden, they can peer through them with desire and the lense will be foggy in the direction of what they desire. Unbeknownst
to them the Jewel is not in Celo, but rather in the Jungle to the north of Celo, but nothing can be done about this at this point.
   More pressingly, Link meets a mysterious man that turn out to be a part of this underground resistance, but he will not allow Link inside as he was directed by HER to only allow one with
"true courage" to meet with her. He then tasks Link with dealing with the pirate raids their village is experiencing, and points Link to their base which is in one of the Necromancer's prisons
they conquered from the Necromancer's forces. The Necromancer cares not for them, as they do not trouble him and they are wreaking havoc which is always appreciated by him.
   As Link sets off into SWI he comes across various biomes within SWI, many fairly extreme. First there is the volcanic region to the southwest, with the massive Mt. Caldum which is so massive
it can be seen by Celo clearly. Mt. Caldum is an active volcano with constant lava flow all around it. The area surrounding the volcano are the lava fields that are extremely hot and riddled
with pools of lava. If Link even sets foot in there without mail with heat protection he will begin to die of the heat. Then there are the plains which are rife with much stronger foes that will
make Link wish he had better armor and weapons. He may find himself to the southeast to Mt. Duratu which is not a volcano but rather a snow capped mountain complete with a frosty landscape around
it. Similarly until Link find himself with armor that can protect himself from the elements he will freeze to death. Luckily he cannot go far into the snow fields as an avalanche had occurred
at the base of the mount, and he meets some people hoping to clear the mess to get home to their village at the base of the mountain.
   Eventually Link will find himself on the southern coast of the island where he is welcomed by Confaltos, village of the ironworkers. Given that their based just south of MT. Caldum with it's
constant lava flow they were able to establish an island wide reputation for crafting the best weapons, armor, and event everyday metal objects. Speaking with the villagers there Link learns
that they have a long history of making high quality metal goods in their Facility that is constantly fed by a massive lava fall, and is directly next to the coast so it is prime for forging.
Upon reaching the village elder Link inquires for a better sword. The elder is willing to grant him his request, but not for free. The elder asks Link if he could go into a subset of their
facility, as the depths are closed to outsiders, and assist them with an issue they have been encountering. 
   This sub area is the main floor of the facility where they store their forged objects, as well as direct the lava and water flow making sure they go into the right areas of the undercroft, 
which is where the actual forging and combining of lava and water happens. The issue they are encountering is that some of the Necromancer's forces have barged in and have started stealing 
weapons and armor as well as tampering with the flow of water and lava, causing damage down under. The elder asks Link to wipe out those troublesome soldiers, and in return he can take their
prized sword Blade of Conflator, the best sword every forged. He does recommend Link to have upgraded armor before entering as these soldiers are not on the weaker side, as well as some other 
more curious threats. And so Link enters the Molten Flooded Forge to end the chaos and acqure a new sword.

   Link encounters a lot of undead animals in the sewers and eventually comes across <IDK>. IDK is considered the Necromancer's Pet as it was the first living thing that he practiced his 
powers on. Link escapes the sewers and makes his way to <VILLAGE NAME> where he finds the underground resistance and finds Zelda.
