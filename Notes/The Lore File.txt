//~~~~~ Prologue ~~~~~//
   In ancient times unknown, there was a thriving kingdom on the island of Vita, named after the purity of life granted by the goddess Haeren. With the Triforce of Life she had full
control over life and death, making life on the island a near paradise by her graces. The lord of the kingdom was intelligent and mindful, always making the best decisions for the
kingdom. However, he coveted the power that Haeren controled and soon hatched a plan to seize her power for himself.

   He ordered the Brigadier of his Legion of Knights, Aemulor, and his legion to capture Hearen's Triforce and take over the island, and eventually vanquish Haeren.
With the cunningness of Aemulor, he led his legion to victory, capturing the Triforce from the goddess, and hid it deep within a remote hidden base.
Almost immediately her power started to drain, as the Triforce, being in the hands of those with such darkness, was tainting the purity of the Triforce.
She, along with the good people of the island, pleaded to the king to find the unknown thieves, and return the Triforce. He agreed, and with many of his guards he sent her on a wild
goose chase, to give him time to spend on learning the power of the Triforce.

   Not long soon after, given that Aemulor's main task was keeping the Triforce hidden, and the king spending much of his time managing the kingdom, gave rise to an unprecedented
opportunity to Aemulor. In his time guarding the Triforce he learned far more than the king did, and began practicing the powers it granted, learning what would eventually be coined
as "Necromancy". Taking those that already had passed on and reviving them in darkness, resulting in a twisted demonic shade of the original being. It did not take the king long to
see that Aemulor was far more knowledgeable with the power of the Triforce. Despite Aemulor swearing complete allegience to the king, the king was uneasy with the situation.

   Eventually Aemulor became so attuned to the power of the Triforce that he was able to sense materials on the island of Vita that could reveal the life force of living beings,
which would give him a better grasp of their being for ease of manipulation. As a result he ordered one of his Colonels, Servus Malus, to scour the island in search of the rare
material. Unfortunately for him there was only one reliable source, in the Krahzen mountains on the northern coast of Vita. As it was a rare material, not much was found and the
material was not one that was easily molded, not even Aemulor could mutate it. Therefore he captured the best smiths on the island, a small family that had already made most of the
island's weapons and armor, to work with it. They succedded in mutating it, giving Aemulor the ability to create talismens that could reveal to him the lifeforce of most living things
around him.

   It was time to make a move, Aemulor's power had peaked, being able to effortlessly exert his intentions on nearly any living and non living being on Vita, it was time to seize
the kingdom and overthrow the king. The king, already having suspicion that Aemulor would attempt a coup, was ready and had his castle fortified to the highest degree. During the siege,
the king could see his soldiers stood no chance, as not only was Aemulor powerful, but he enhanced his legion. Bearing new armor and weapons infused with darkness under the name Undead
Legion, as they were all enhanced living dead soldiers that could not die unless Aemulor deemed it so. The skirmish was swift, as Aemulor was able to control all of the king's fallen
soldiers during the battle, increasing his numbers. Desperate, the king fled to Haeren, who had grown so weak from her Triforce not only being stolen, but corrupted. The king revealed
his intentions led by jealosy, but vowed to reclaim her Triforce in her name. She was unable to assist, as she had never known humans to claim a Triforce and command it with such
ferocity and accuracy.

   Haeren was powerless, only the other goddesses themselves could stop the coming apocalypse of the newly titled Necromancer Aemulor. Eventually the goddesses did come to the aid of
the isolated island, and were able to contain Aemulor to the island of Vita. After a ferocious war that nearly obliterated the island, the goddesses were able to separate the Triforce
from Aemulor, and removed it from the island, quickly draining Aemulor's power. The goddesses created a remote island that could not be sailed to by normal ships, one that was hidden
in the middle of the ocean, and erected a temple designed to prevent anyone from claiming the Triforce and risking another global apocalypse. Unfortunately as her Triforce was mutated
by Aemulor only a hero with a pure heart could cleanse it, resulting in Haeren herself diminishing before the eyes of the golden goddesses, barely able to communicate with the living
plane. Simultaneously, Aemulor's power had also weakened greatly, the power he once controlled took a toll on his physical form, causing him and his forces to deteriorate. However,
their spirits were volatile and resiliant and would not leave the land, resulting in a dark corrupted blemish on the once beautiful island.

   The king, still king of Vita, swore to never again tamper with forces of the gods, isolating the dark side of the island and living out the rest of his days paranoid that he may
see the dark arts performed once again. The war against Aemulor left the island in an irrepairable state, forever tainting the land. As a result the island was known as the island
of Interitus.

   Ages passed, the king's decendents slowly found themselves unable to properly rule the land, resulting in a power vacuum that would be taken advantage of by residents that shared
some of the darkness permanently left being by the Necromancer Aemulor and his Undead Legion. Dark spirits roamed the lands, causing minor infractions amongst the people who were
losing grace left behind by Haeren. The events unfolding on Hyrule, slowly found their way to Interitus through the occassional sailing passerby visiting the forsaken land. Talk of
heroes saving lands from evil circulated around the residents who so desperately needed a hero to return order and peace to their home, leading many to pray for such an adventurer
would arrive... only to be disappointed. The Legend of the Calamity of Vita became the mythos of the people of Interitus, the time the island was nearly destroyed by a once powerful
evil that could topple gods and control life and death. So did the once worshipped shining silver Triforce of Hearen, of which, like the goddess, faded out of legend only to be
vaguely referenced in ancient forgotten texts.

//=========================================================================================================================================================================================//
\\~~~~~ The Scholar ~~~~~\\
   Upon Link's eventual defeat of Ganon, 7 years after Ganon had abused the power of the Triforce of Power and taken over Hyrule, peace returned and would be rebuild from the tyranny
of the dark lord.It was at this time that a Hylian scholar who had been studying the Triforces of the three golden goddesses wanted to venture out and see the world. Perhaps it was the
passing of the ages, or the evils of the world fading into obscurity, or even dumb luck that the impenetrable barrier sealing the Isle of Haeren had faded, and in the travels of the
Hylian scholar the island was discovered. The scholar, with his sizable platoon, investigated the ancient decrepit island. There was a neutral but uneasy feeling to the island, like
something lay sleeping waiting to be reawakened inside. The potency of the power that once coursed through the Triforce made it almost hypnotic to humans, and could very easily corrupt
their hearts. Eventually the scholar, fighting through ancient ruined traps and grotesque monsters unlike that which they have ever seen, found the temple's antechamber chamber.
   Upon entering he encountered a slumbering undead; An ancient hero chosen by Haeren, of whom she thought had a pure enough heart to restore the light within her Triforce. He had
succumbed to the Triforce, and performed dark arts in the temple, even being able to use the darkness to summon ancient souls onto the island, most notable the soul of a member of the
Undead Legion which acted as his personal guard. Unable to leave the encased island by the power of the golden three, knew that like himself, Haeren would attempt to summon another
unsuspecting hero to cleanse the triforce. Over the ages he fell into a deep sleep inside the antechamber of the temple. Luckily for the scholar he was able to acquire the Triforce
under the negligence of the ancient undead, escaping the island with an unexpected treasure. Returning to his ship he began his enthusiastic studies on the dark Triforce, as it was
unheard of that there was a fouth one in existence.

   In time the expedition found the Island of Interitus. Hyrule was aware of the lands of Interitus, but not much of it's history and status. The Hylians were welcomed with open arms,
as the people and recent generationshave not known any symbols of authority or security. They pleaded with the soldiers to retake the ancient castle that once was the symbol of strength
and prosperity of Interitus. No more than a year later and the soldiers claimed the castle, as well as the various towers around the island to establish order, and snuff out any brigands
and criminals. During this time of establishing order that the good soldiers of Hyrule enacted, gave the scholar a lot of time to get very familiar with the dark Triforce, but he could
not seem to make anything of it. It layed dormant, like something or someone was holding the door shut, not allowing him in. He felt there had to be something on the island that could
potentially awaken the Triforce given its close history with the island. He explored, ventured into the island following the feeling of dread left behind on the island with a small
platoon of soldiers, as well as his adopted son Daserta. Daserta was an orphan that the scholar had mentored on hyrule, about the same age as Link, whom he had serving as his right
hand, man.

   In their time following this unknown darkness, they came accross a secluded portion of the island that writhed with the darkness the scholar had been following. Clutching the darkened
Triforce in hishands, he entered the darkness. He found a treasure trove of artifacts forign to the scholar, ancient texts describing things that he had never heard of; 'necromancy'. Soon
after poking through somedocuments, the Triforce bursted from his grip filling the whole area with the darkness. As if a bomb went off, the Triforce reacted violently with the area around
them. The darkness filled those present, like leeches grasping onto a host. After regaining their conciousness, the company left the ruins unsure of what happened and unaware of what they
set in motion. Not long after returning to their home in the castle, the scholar was able to interact with the Triforce in ways he was not expecting, not only was the Triforce reacting to
his will but it seemed to feel natural. He felt powerful, nothing like he felt with the other Triforces. Quickly he started playing around with his newfound powers. One night he summoned
all that was in the company that led the expedition into the ruins. They all had felt the power of the Triforce, they all felt the connected darkness they had awakened. That night was plan
to take full control over the island of Interitus was made.

   What followed was the making of history repeating itself. The scholar gives out his plans to his soldiers that they are to take full control over the island, and eliminate all that
oppose by force. Many of the soldiers refused, as it went against their directive of exploring new lands and helping anyone in need. Those that opposed were either executed or fled the
castle. Those that stayed were granted power by the Necromancer. With the new threat the Scholar presented, the soldiers that defected from the Scholar setup posts in the towns of
Interitus. They trained who they could to aid in the defense of the innocent, and readied for any incoming attacks. The Scholar had spent enough time with the Triforce to nearly
efforlessly control the being around him, claiming the ancient title of Necromancer he had read in the texts of old. Daserta, serving ever still as the Necromancer's right hand, could
sense the darkness growing within the man that had shown him kindness, but could not defy him as thoughts of such made him guilty and afraid to go against his wishes.

   With the Necromancer's power growing, and the power of Aemulor slowly reawakening, members of Aemulor's Undead Legion begin to rise up, as they heard their master's call through the
Triforce of Death. The Necromancer, controlling them, orders his new legionnaires to train his most elite hylian guards in the combative ways of the ancient legion. After word of this
Necromancer spread around the island, a messenger was sent back to Hyrule to inform the Hyrulian government that a grave threat is growing on the Island of Interitus that could potentially
pose a threat to the world. As a result Link and Zelda were sent out, having defeated Ganon and controlling the power of the golden Triforces, to stop the terror caused by the Necromancer's
terrible necromancy.
\\~~~~~ The Scholar ~~~~~\\
//=========================================================================================================================================================================================//
<<<GAME BEGINS>>>

   As Link and Zelda sail for the island now known as Interitus, they are encountered by a massive sea serpent known to legend as the Leviathan. They commence battle, eventually resulting
in the Leviathan destroying their ship, sending all on board into the seas around Interitus. With the waning power of Haeren, she influenced Link's arrival on her secluded island. She
explained that Link is the only one who could fix all that happened ages ago. That he could restore the light in her Triforce by returning the Triforce to her temple and with his pure
heart, restoring the light within purging the evil that claimed it. However first, he would need to purge the darkness plaguing the temple.

<Mini Dungeon 1: Temple of Haeren>
~Amalgamation of Decay: ---Shambles---~
   Link defeats a powerful undead residing within the temple. The arrival of Link on the island as a result of Haeren's intervention awoke the ancient failed hero residing within the temple.
He knew as he predicted that the goddess would indeed summon a successor to him, which he could use to potentially escape the island. Shocking to him however, his source of power had been
removed, reducing his powers substantially but given the dark Triforce still held the potent darkness, was able to maintain control of his raised undead and called them into action and to
take down this new hero.
   After defeating the shambled evil, Haeren gives Link means to leave the island in a raft left behind by the ancient fallen hero. She wishes Link success in his journey as he sails off to
Interitus. While sailing to Interitus, he is encountered by the Leviathan once again who informs him that going to the island of Interitus is exactly what the Necromancer wants, as he and
Zelda possess the other three Triforce, of which the Necromancer could combine the powers to become the most powerful god to ever exist. The Leviathan once again attacks Link with a massive
tidal wave, but with the last of her power Haeren protects Link, and saftely gets him to Interitus. Link wakes up in a teepee on the eastern coast of Interitus, greeted by an old man who
informs him of the situation on the island. The old man has knowledge of the events on Hyrule, as well as much of the recent history of Interitus, giving him great insight. He even informs
Link that the Triforce that came with He and Zelda were lost to the Necromancer's forces. Where the old man doesnt know directly how to help Link with his goal of stopping the Necromancer,
he gives him guidance and peace of mind. He informs Link that it would be wise to start in the forest to the north of the nearby village of Viridi, as it has seen some supernatural events
taking place and could be a good place to start. The old man also expresses confusion of why the Necromancer would split up his triforce.
   the Necromancer, under the control of Aemulor through the Triforce, was made to split them up in hopes that Link would be more powerful than the Scholar, giving Aemulor potential for a
stronger host.
   After exploring around the nearby areas of the northeastern side of the island and talking with the locals, Link learns that one of the Necromancer's minions has awakened an ancient beast
in a lair found deep within the Cumpura Forest. The ancient beast is known as the Hazarond, a monster that thrives in natural oils, and has the ability to breath fire to ignite the oils it
excretes as a self defense mechanism. With one of Aemulor's many expeditions for the materials that grant the ability to sense the life force within beings, he came across this already ancient
lair, and deemed it not worth the trouble, as even he did not want to discover it's wrath, as the oil-fire combination could cause untold damage to his forces, as they were all undead and
highly flammable.

<<Level 1 - Pernicious Grotto>>
~Source of Corruption: ---Hazarond---~

   Link investigates the lair and learns of the Necromancer's follower that ventured into the grotto, learning more about the Hazarond, until he learns that the follow had be claimed by
the ancient beast upon defeating it. Link claims a shard of his Triforce of Courage within the grotto. Word gets around through the Necromancer's soldiers that as expected, Link and
Zelda have arrived on the island, and Link has claimed one of the Triforce shards.

<Battle Arena 1: Raccoon Hollow>
~Gargantuan Bandit of the Forest ---Overgrown Racoon---~

   Link ventures around more of the island and finds himself in the company of highly intelligent racoons. It is said in few obfuscated texts that with the grace of some ancient magic,
even the animals were able to communicate with the peoples of Interitus. While mostly confused, Link encounteres a guard that was once in the higher circles of the Necromancer's ranks,
and hears of what the Necromancer was involved with. Hushed tones about something big, something even the Necromancer himself was wary of. Eventually, Link encounters a concerned father
outside of an ancient abandoned mine. His son went into the mine to practice his archery on the Keese within, but with the Father having hurt himself, tasks Link to take his lantern
and get his son out.

<<Level 2: Derelict Quarry>>
~Colonel of Darkness ---Servus Malus---~

   Link finds the father's son, who gifts Link with his bow as well as the knowledge of a determined soldier, saying something about going deeper into the mine to take care of some
long overdue business. Link finds his way  into the depths of the mine and walks in on that soldier, yelling in an open room, accusing some being of mistreating his descendent. A spector
reveals itself, the cursed spirit of Servus Malus, high ranking Colonel of Aemulor,  tasked to find one of the rarest resources on the island. Outside of the control of the Colonel,
the material was tapped in the Krahzen mountains making Servus unable to deliver what Aemulor wanted. As a result of the failure,  he and all of his remaining miners were cursed by
Aemulor to forever roam the tunnels of the mine never to have peace. Servus, still seething at this failure taunts the soldier. Seemingly proud of his cruelty and mistreatment of the
miners that had failed him, he slanders the soldier's descendent, degrading him to ants digging insignificant tunnels. Link intervenes after Servus launches the soldier across the room
with ease, incapacitating him.  Link and Servus battle. After successfully weakening Servus, as he cannot truly be banished being bound to the power of Aemulor, he vanishes. Link talks
to the injured solder, learning that he is a descendent of one of the miners that were present on the islands centuries ago, and he only went on the expedition with the scholar because
he felt it was the best opportunity to get out of Hyrule and possibly find Interitus.

   It is heard amonst the guards in the Necromancer's castle that Link defeated an ancient Undead Legion Colonel. The guards know little of the Undead Legion of Aemulor, as the Necromancer
has kept much of the original history locked up in his study. They express minor concern that Link is already gaining a lot of power, and that the Necromancer should be informed.
Later, Link finds a remote house near the mines occupied by the family of the Father  and Son as well as the soldier. The Son found the soldier wandering out of the mine injured, and
took him back to their house for rest. Link learns that the family living in the house are also decended from one of the miners that  mined during the Calamity of Vita, and after
finding out that the soldier is also a descendent, agreed to let him rest in their house, and trade tales of their lineage. The soldier informs Link that since Link helped him battle
Servus, he would aid Link on his quest as needed once he recovers. The soldier also tells Link that he was stationed at the guard tower outside of Viridi village, and was told to
attack the village. He, not sypathetic to the Necromancer, gives  Link a key into the tower and tells him he should stop their plans before they wipe out the village. Wiping out the
village would give the Necromancer a significant advantage, as he knows any Hyrulian aid would come from the east.

<Mini Dungeon 2: Seized Guardtower>
~Lieutenant of Darkness ---Legatus---~
   Along the way up the tower, Link encounters a soldier locked up in the barracks. He tells Link that he does not sypathise with the Necromancer. Link, unlocking the door, set him
free where he flees to Viridi village to rest and hide (he ends up in the main barracks building where Link got the Cumpura Key. Eventually, Link reaches the summit where the leader of the
tower resides. Legatus is a Lieutenant of the Necromancer, a soldier that was given additional privilege by the Necromancer, learning combat from a Legionnaire. Upon defeating the elite guard,
Link finds a signet with the Hylian symbol on it, which belonged to the soldier locked up in the tower. The elite guard's intention was to use the signet to infiltrate the non corrupt
soldiers' hideouts with surprise attacks. It is a symbol of opposition to the Necromancer, proving allegiance to Hyrule and not the Necromancer. Through adventuring Link finds a hidden
tunnel near the center of the northeastern plains that takes him to a ruined house in the desert storm plagued village of Auri. The tunnel was dug by a cultist to give easier access to the
Shrine of Egentem.
   Link finds Auri is mostly locked off, given the unending storm's rage. He does however find some residents open to letting him inside. One resident being the mayor of the village,
concerned for his village, pleads with Link to help. He suspects what could be the cause of the storms could be from a curse he read about in books from Auri Library, a library containing
most of Interitus's remaining written history. The curse being that there is evil in the ruins the well was built to cover and attempting to enter them could reawaken an evil that would
engulf their village in an unending storm, and he wants Link to go down there and vanquish the evil.
   Back during the age of Aemulor's reign, he had an outpost in modern day Auri village, and used it as a watch tower to keep an eye on the border between the northern and southern
regions of the island. During the Calamity of Vita, the tower was destroyed, and layed in ruin as most of the soldiers, including another one of his Colonels, was buried in sand. As the
ages passed, Auri was constructed, and a well was placed intentionally over the buried ruins in an attempt to prevent anyone from reentering the ruins.

   The mayor speaks of a resident in Auri that had knowledge on the curse and how to enter the well. The resident was odd to say the least, spent very little time in the village, always
in his house and muttering frantically to himself. One day this resident gave the mayor a key to his house, and told him to save it for an adventurer. This resident is a member of the
Cult of Egentem, led by a crazed "mage". The reason this resident was rarely seen by those in his village was because he often took his secret tunnel to the plains to get to the
Shrine of Egentem to hear the word of the "mage".
   The shrine was originally called the Shrine of Aemulor, the place of worship for the original Necromancer Aemulor that orchestrated the Calamity of Vita. As the ages proceeded the
shrine became overgrown with vegetation, and to the current inhabitants of the island it is just known as a place of darkness, presumed to be a remnant from the legend of the Calamity.
It wasn't until "Egentem the Reborn" claimed it after his transformation and used it's dark presense as his stronghold and place to spread his knowledge to the cult he founded.
   The mayor gives Link the key to the resident's house. Link eventually finds the resident, dead. Turns out he died in his secret tunnel to Dodongos, and was revived from the
Necromancer. He gives Link little information about himself, extatic that he is dead as that makes him a chosen follower of "Egentem the Reborn", and gives Link his Ocarina, as it is
needed to enter the Shrine of Egentem, and he does not need to ocarina to enter given he is undead. Those who are living can only enter the shrine using the tune. On Link's way to the
Shrine of Egentem, he finds the small village of Silva guarded by non corrupt hylian soldiers which allows him into the village, given he has the signet of allegiance. Link learns that
the village is near the front lines of where the Necromancer's forces come from down south, and express concern for the village. The guards there express their direness towards the
Necromancer forces coming very close to the village, and ask Link to end the Necromancer. Link finds himself at the Shrine of Egentem, where he meets a very extravagantly dressed cultist
frantically wanting to get into the shrine and does not have anyway to play the tune. Link plays the tune and enters the shrine with the cultist, who vanishes almost instantly.

<<Level 3: Shrine of Egentem>>
~Cult Patriarch ---Egentem---~

   Throughout Link's time in the shrine he can see that cultist from the entrance watching him from atop the walls. Upon reaching the main chamber of the shrine the cultist outside the
entrance reveals himself to be the cult leader Egentem. He knew Link would would arrive at his shrine, as word traveled fast of Link's arrival and journey thus far, and would want the triforce
shard he possesses. During the battle it can be clearly seen that this "mage" does not do anything with magic. As it turns out, despite Egentem's claims of being reborn in darkness, he possesses
no necromancy, but rather is completely delusional. They battle and Link is victorious.
   Egentem is a man convinsed that he is the ancient evil from the Legend of the Calamity of Vita reborn, and knows nothing of the scholar. He is seen as a normal man in extravagant full body
robes, but underneath he is actually undeadlike most cultists, and the reason for their robes is that he cannot be in sunlight. He is the product of some of the Necromancer's early experimentation
with the triforce. He was a normal man from the village of Conflatos, captured, killed, and brought back with the triforce, but remembers the experience as having a near death experience where an
ancient evil saved him from eternal torment and believes he is the chosen one. He is known throughout the cult that he is undead, and the only reason he could be living is through the power of the
ancient evil. His only power is his abilities with physical combat, wielding a shield and a hammer which stems from his past of being one of the famed smiths of Conflatos. His biggest accomplishment
is the forging of the Blade of Conflatos, which is treasured among arms men.
   Upon leaving the Shrine, a guard is standing outside of the shrine and speaks to Link urgently saying he found out where zelda is, and she was captured by the Necromancer's forces,
held in the in the guardtower's dungeon outside Viridi. Link asks to see his signet of allegiance but the guard insists the situation is too dire for such trinkets. Upon getting to
the tower and into the dungeon, Link is ambushed by a bunch of the Necromancer's forces, including the soldier that led him there. Their intention was not to kill Link, but rather keep
him detained until the necromancer could arrive. At this point Link has 2 options; Wait in the cell for the necromancer to arrive or attempt a jail break, either scenario ends in him
captured, but the jail break one give some additional dialogue with the necromancer where he gives link an "option" of joining him willingly, in which case if Link says yes the
necromancer basically ignores Link knowing he would not go willingly.
   Unfortunately for the Necromancer his plans happened out of order. His plan was to capture Zelda and use her to convinse Link to join his cause, but his forces have still yet to find Zelda.
The Necromancer would like to still leverage the might of Link, but worries that if he doesnt kill him then there is a good change he could escape.
   Eventually, while Link is locked up in the dungeons, the Necromancer's Right Hand visits and speaks to Link. He explains who he is and his concerns for the Scholar, he wants to
help Link escape but cannot be seen helping. He quickly opens Link's cell and tells him to escape through a weak wall that he uses to leave discretely. Unbenownst to anyone, he leaves
the castle occassionally to help various Hylian soldiers by giving them insight to the Necromancer's plans.

<Battle Arena 2: Reformed Pirate Cave>
~Pirate Theifmaster---Latros---~
   Link finds that the cave that is connected to the Necromancer's dungeon leads to the home of many undead pirates that do not appear to be hostile, but rather extremely passive. Upon
speaking to them Link learns that they were once a part of a crew of an ancient pirate lord that heard tell of a Jewel on Vita that would allow them to rule the seas by controlling the waves.
Speaking with the pirates Link learns that they were defeated by Aemulor, and were never able to recover the Jewel. One of the pirates mentions that they thought it was once in the marsh
lands on the eastern coast of Vita, but were never able to traverse it as it was not worth attempting to enter given the curse that lied upon it, as well as just being generally dangerous.
As Link exits the cave he finds himself at the village of Celo, as Right Hand recommended. He finds that the villagers are experiencing issue with nightly raids from undead pirates, part of
the same crew as Link met just moments ago. The villagers do not know why the pirates raid, but the reason is they suspect the Jewel is in the direction of the village, as they have the magic
from Lenses of Truth at their disposal, and when peering in their lenses they can see a fogginess in the direction of Celo. These pirates are not typical pirates, they are knowledgeable of
magic and have special Lenses that do more than simply show the hidden, they can peer through them with desire and the lense will be foggy in the direction of what they desire. Unbeknownst
to them the Jewel is not in Celo, but rather in the Jungle to the north of Celo, but nothing can be done about this at this point.

   More pressingly, Link meets Celo's elder which turns out to be a part of a resistance force known as the "Goddess Faithful", but he will not allow Link inside as he was directed by "her" to
only allow one with "true courage" to meet with her. He then tasks Link with dealing with the pirate raids their village is experiencing, and points Link to their base which is in one of the
Necromancer's prisons they conquered from the Necromancer's forces. The Necromancer knows of them and how they conquered the prison, but it did not concern him enough as he knew they would not
dare attack his castle. Additionally he knew they did not care about him, but rather their jewel.

   As Link sets off into SWI he comes across various biomes within SWI, many fairly extreme. First there is the volcanic region to the southwest, with the massive Mt. Caldum which is so massive
it can be seen by Celo clearly. Mt. Caldum is an active volcano with constant lava flow all around it. The area surrounding the volcano are the lava fields that are extremely hot and riddled
with pools of lava. If Link even sets foot in there without mail with heat protection he will begin to die of the heat. Then there are the plains which are rife with much stronger foes that will
make Link wish he had better armor and weapons. He may find himself to the southeast to Mt. Duratu which is not a volcano but rather a snow capped mountain complete with a frosty landscape around
it. Similarly until Link find himself with armor that can protect himself from the elements he will freeze to death. Luckily he cannot go far into the snow fields as an avalanche had occurred
at the base of the mount, and he meets some people hoping to clear the mess to get home to their village at the base of the mountain. He can meet the husband of a woman in Celo that is there
helping the cause. If Link helps them clear the snow (Powder Keg) he will return to Celo and his wife rewards you with a heart piece.

   During Link's adventuring he will come across a secluded dwelling in a tree just south of Castle Interitus as well as a small graveyard. Upon entering Link find an old man, very aggressively
warning him not to tamper with any of the headstones. If Link tampers with the headstones then goes back into the tree, he will be attacked by the old gravetender. He is a very easy win and just
tells Link to leave. However, if Links enters the center grave and kill the Redead within Link will obtain a Strange Coffer. Entering the tree with the coffer forces the old man to reel back and lament
on it. The old man was once an avid adventurer, reaching from the highest peaks to the deepest depths on Interitus. During that time, his mother made him a very durable cold resistant suit
that allowed him to take his adventuring to the max. As time passed she died, and his whole family started to pass and in his time caring for their tombs he became known as a hermit gravekeeper.
Given his advanced age and the passing of his mother he buried the armor with her. With the Necromancer's necromancy he noticed his mother as well as the rest of his family were returning
undead. He then warns anyone coming by to not open the tombs as he has them well contained, and opening the tombs would release them. Bringing the coffer to him shows him that Link did open the
tomb, but Link was also capable of putting his mother down for good. He thanks Link for giving her a final rest and rewards him with the Adventurer's Mail.

   Eventually Link will find himself on the southern coast of the island where he is welcomed by Confaltos, village of the ironworkers. Given that their based just south of MT. Caldum with it's
constant lava flow they were able to establish an island wide reputation for crafting the best weapons, armor, and event everyday metal objects. Speaking with the villagers there Link learns
that they have a long history of making high quality metal goods in their Facility that is constantly fed by a massive lava fall, and is directly next to the coast so it is prime for forging.
Upon reaching the village elder Link inquires for a better sword. If Link has not found the Adventurer's Mail the elder turns down his request, stating it would be too dangerous. If Links has
the Adventurer's Mail, the elder is willing to grant him his request, but not for free. The elder asks Link if he could go into the top layer of their facility, as the depths are closed to
outsiders, and assist them with an issue they have been encountering.
   In the elder's house Link can read a missive from the Necromancer's captain, Duxo, saying that the elder's refusal to continue to meet the demands of the Necromancer
will not be tolerated and that he will come and take everything by force. As can be seen upon arrival they were in the process of that when the elder locked them in the forge with the
security system they have. So Duxo and his forces are now trapped within the forge, tampering and sabotaging the upper layers, as the lower layers are locked given how dangerous they are.
And so Link enters the Molten Flooded Forge to end the chaos and acqure a new sword.

<Mini Dungeon 3: Molten Flooded Forge>
~Captain of Darkness ---Duxo---~

   Upon entering the top level of the forge which is where the flow of lava and water are controlled for the lower levels to help in the forging process down under. This layer is much more
habitable in terms of temperature given it mainly diverts the flows and is storage for all of the forged equipment. Link can see break rooms and storage rooms throughout along with stronger
soldiers utilizing some of those stronger weaponry. These soldiers are in general stronger since this is a point of interest and on the southern portion of the island so closer to the
Necromancer's castle which he wants well fortified. Going through the forge Link will find himself in some of the underground tunnels the miners have dug granting access to other areas in
the forge. None of these tunnels interact with the lower levels but are reminiscent of them. Eventually, by killing the enemy soldiers and turning on the forge's devices, Link restores the
water and lava flows to gain access to the primary mixing and storage room where he finds Duxo locked in. Duxo was after the prized Blade of Conflator, but found it locked as well as being
sealed within the chamber. When his soldiers started screwing with the forge's flows and such that put the inner chamber on lockdown, locking him in there. Link, having found the master
key of the forge (boss key), was able to open the chest, and can even use this masterly crafted blade against Duxo.

Having defeated Duxo and purging the Forge of the enemy, the elder thanks Link and informs him that the forging of equipment will recommence, but only for those agaist the Necromancer.

   With Link's new sword as well as the Adventurer's Mail he found from the old advenurer, he is now ready to fulfill Celo's elder's request to deal with the pirate threat coming from the overthrown
prison.

<<Level 4: Pillaged Prison>>
~Quartermaster  ---Quickknife---~

   This was a pretty typical prison used by the Necromancer until an overwhelming amount of pirates rose and retook the prison. Back when this ancient crew fought against Aemulor he had them all
imprisoned there, and when the Necromancer began toying with necromancy they rose. The hylian guards were no match for the pirates, so they fully conquered the prison and use it as their home base.
The crew's leader currently is Quartermaster Quickknife, the original quartermaster of the crew second in command to Blackguard Ignav. Ignav and Aemulor fought at the height of the crew's seige of
Vita, even though Ignav was orignally only there for the jewel, they did pillage a lot of the island. Aemulor saw that as an invasion of his home and so with his power sought to
destroy the pirates. This did prove to be somewhat difficult as these pirates led by Ignav were not typical people, they had knowledge of magic and could focus it in the tools they used. As a result
they could shoot concentrated magic from defense turrets as well as even shoot projections of their swords. The height of their innovation came in the form of magical lenses that could reveal things
that are hidden to the naked eye, as well as reveal the location of what the holder desired. The jewel Ignav was obssessed with was to be known as the Jewel of Marre, a jewel that would further
enhance Ignav's magical abilities. On the surface it would allow him to control the seas to enhance their travel and prowess while sailing, but the potential when combined with is existing power
would certainly make him a contendor for a world conquerer.

   With these abilities they were able to hold of the forces of Aemulor and Ignav was even able to stand up to him for awhile, long enough for Aemulor to fear slightly for his survival. Ultimately he
did reign victorious, and condemned Ignav and his crew to the prison. However, after Aemulor's defeat at the hands of the goddesses, the pirates made their prison a home and converted it into their
sanctuary. They perfected their abilities within and it turned into a fortress of mysticism. When the necromancer began reintroducing necromancy the crew rose, including Ignav and his second in
command Quickknife. Quickknife was a prodigy with the magical abilities of Ignav, and was the quickest of the crew. He had one sibling Latros, who was not as magically inclined, but was a natural at
pickpocketing.

   As link proceeds through the prison, dealing with all of the magical traps and abilities of the undead crew he eventually comes into contact with Quickknife. Link defeats him but like with his fight
with latros, he asks Link to give his regards to Latros. With Link's lense of truth in hand he is able to proceed onward across SWI.

   Upon Link's return to Celo and speaking to the elder, he permits Link talk with "her" granting him admission to the cave left of his house. Inside Link will see a lot of Hylian guards as well as
civilians that want to aid the cause. Speaking with the inhabitants Link can learn a lot of history about the island from the islander's perspective.

   The Goddess Faithful were formed during the age of Vita and by the grace of Haeren. They are people who follow the goddess's will very closly and honored all 4 goddesses, looking out for any threat
to their graceful existance. During the Calamity of Vita they were the main champions of the goddesses that fought against the forces of Aemulon, unforutantely their attempts were futile, and the force
of Aemulon, with the power of the Triforce of Death, were far too much for them. After the defeat they scattered and went into hiding. In hiding, these goddess faithful maintained the events and cause
in their descendents, but were always told to keep their anscestry hidden, lest dark forces seek them out. With the coming of the Scholar, the descendents of these faithful knew they could not hide
anymore, as another calamity was coming as they could feel a darkness on the island and knew that the great necromancer Aemulon's power was reawakened. As they all gathered in Celo, some of the faithful
traveling from Viridi found Zelda washed ashore along with some of the guards from Link's voyage. They rescued them and brought them with to their rendezvous in SWI. Other faithful ran into some of the
guards that crashed with Link and Zelda and joined the travelers. As everyone gathered in the underground base Zelda was cared for, many of the guards that crashed with here relieved to see she is alive,
but still wondering where Link was, as he has yet to be sighted on Interitus. In time Zelda came to, but unfortunately completely lost her memory. Her guards tried to jog her memory to no avail, luckily
for them she was the same old Zelda either way, hearing the stories from the Interitus residents in the compound as well as the history from book and the faithful made her motivated to help the cause.
Very quickly she rose the ranks of the group and eventually was leading decision and missions, second only to the main lead of the group. Still yet to regain memory of who she is and Link is as a whole,
she works with the head when planning how they will take down the Necromancer

   Once Zelda sees Link, she is excited, but only because she knows that there has been a powerful swordsman taking out the Necromancer's forces and even escaped capture. Not to mention he selflessly
charged into the Pirate base just for the aid of the village. She expresses her gratitude for Link's actions. While trying to plan their next actions Zelda informs link that each of the major villages they
would like to help are blocked by something;
   - The Zora village in the Carulem archipeligo has a wall
   - The village on Duratu has a snow wall blocking the road, plus it is too cold.
   - Palus village in Venenom Marsh woudl take them right past the necromancer's castle
   - The Goron village in Caldum as the lava wastes are too dangerous and hot
Zelda asks Link to talk to a pirate and an engineer since they seem to have ideas on how to proceed. The engineer mentions his brother in Auri village is working on an explosive strong enough to blast
through the wall and the snow on Duratu. The only issue is how to return to the northern side of the island. They cannot access the Auri Desert pass as they would need to get through checkpoints that are
locked down by Necromancer forces, plus they would need to pass by the Necromancer's castle and would be spotted. The pirate mentions that if they had a grappling hook they could take a pass behind the
castle to reach Auri Desert, and he knows of the whereabouts of one in the Summus mountain range diving the northern and southern sides of the island in the cave system. He mentions that Link has a
Lens of Truth, which can reveal hidden secrets and that the way into the pass is obscured, but a Lens can reveal it. If Link could venture into that cave system and find a grappling hook, he could make
his way to Auri desert and get the bombs needed to access the other villages.
   It is decided then, says Zelda. Link will venture into the cave system of Mt. Summus, find a grappling hook to reach Auri Desert, and take the desert pass to Auri desert and find the guy making
bombs. Talking to this pirate more Link learns where the cave is located. Going through MT. Summus, which is extremely flooded
