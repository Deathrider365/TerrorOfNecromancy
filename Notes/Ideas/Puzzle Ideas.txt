like from glory squad, ice block puzzles but you can push (perhaps a hot block) that thaws the ice allowing
a block to stop sliding (prob just an undercombo) (but there can also be switches on the non slidy area
making the puzzle more complex)

you turn bouncy things that throw link (similar to the arrow combos from IoR) and they have traps that leave link in
pits

like warp mazes, have dive mazes

push blocks into water

statues looking at eachother denoting which one to hit (last one looked at is the one to hit)

legend of link new legacy concept from Skyward Sword where activating something triggers invincible golems that slowly chase you
