floating castle FF1 aesthetic and music

Metroid 2 dark aether dot in darkness or something

Dark caves with lit wall sconces that actually have realistic light (think lvl 1 from promised lands)

Snowy area at the base of a mountain, and the mountain itself is a heavy blizzard (think frozen hyrule FSA)

My big mountain can be the dungeon itself where you go in and out of the mountain during the dungeon (think
abyssal mountains from Tower of Courage)

Between SWI and SEI is where the poison swamp will be and the reason for it being poison is because of the
undersea source of toxicity (this will be the dungeon with the whirlpool) to get to SEI you pass through 
the swamp

The Forgotton Capital ~name~

expand the ship from the opening sequence (dining area or something)

similar to ocarina how you had to follow a ghost through a desert to prevent getting lost, you have to follow footprints...
