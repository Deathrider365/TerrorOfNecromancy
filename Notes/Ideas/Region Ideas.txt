the blue forest will have the first mini dungeon and its lore is that it was all caused by toxins generated by one of the necormancer's
defected research assistants that wanted to pursue their own research, resulting in a toxin that when exposed to the air turns

Metroid 2 dark aether dot in darkness or something

Dark caves with lit wall sconces that actually have realistic light (think lvl 1 from promised lands)

My big mountain can be the dungeon itself where you go in and out of the mountain during the dungeon (think
abyssal mountains from Tower of Courage)

the swamp
