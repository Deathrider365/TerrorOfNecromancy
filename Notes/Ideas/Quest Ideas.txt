you are aiding a warrior that is hunting his nemesis, you find out eventually that his nemesis is also kind of a
good guy and you are foreced to make a decision who to kill, one option gives armor or something and the other idk

a husband and wife that defected from the legion, one was caught but let go, not before being cursed and is slowly 
turning into undead as punishment. you have to aid them to help them from turning. Even have a flashback scene
where it is shown what happened

somewhere along the way you find yourself having to hunt a legionnaire, but once you get to him he is actually helpful
and warns you what will happen if you assemble the 20 rings and he confirms that you want his, if you decide you do,
then he informs you about the way of the paladin
