Grab the darknut tile from DtT+ episode 21 6:46

random encounters like from BOAB

I know of the normal legionnaire sprites, but perhaps as the game goes on they "evolve" into the
larger prite like am2r's metroids

If you leave a legionnaire alive at low health too long they spawn another one for backup
and play a whistle sound when that happens
