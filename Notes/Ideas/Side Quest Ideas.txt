dirty fountain in the desert town have a quest where there is a "bottom of the well esq" 
dungeon to have to clear the fountain (the combos for it change to reflect clean water)
Doing so result in say, allowing the player to continue the trading side quest and even
new items to buy in the shop that couldnt be bought otherwise

one where there is a conflict between bad and good zoras
