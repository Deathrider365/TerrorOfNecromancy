boss that latches on and absorbs life or maybe magic and it would actually heal the boss for as long as you are 
latched and the only way off is with a light weapon (probably a bonus boss or enemy, maybe a dungeon boss)

boss where there is a ray of light moving around the room which may be unlocked throughout the dungeon and the 
only way to beat this boss is to wait for the light to hit a reflector which enlightens the room killing the boss


a boss who's life is linked to a timer and the only way to kill him is to avoid him and not let him devour 
\spawning enemies which give him health and if he does hit you or absorb the spawning enemies he is healed, 
he is impervious to your attacks except maybe you can stun him or something

a fast pased boss that does 3 fast warps around the room, and on the third appears right by link 
and swings at him (with build up) and he does this constantly

phantom from the messenger is in the game. In his search to revive Muse, his lover, he come across the necromancer whom
he hears can bring back those who had died. He tasks phantom to kill link in order to help him. 
he will have all the same attacks, sfx, and boss music from the messenger. Have him refer to whatever it was he needed
to get to the music box or whatever since this is before he is trapped there. Have the music that plays outside his boss room play
when you enter the room where you encounter him. and have the sound of hitting him be the same as from the game, basically
mimic to messenger entirely. This will replace the hall of memories from IoR. 

Level 1 boss name: Amalgamation of Decay ---   ---

the boss (that is essentially going to be my stan) the first phase he is chained and the goal is to
break him free so you can eliminate him

How a deathrider boss that actually is a thing. perhaps he is just a normal legionnaire but somewhere
you find out that that particular legionnaire was rumored to have been from another realm where he
served under an emperor (referring to FFII)

essentially a patra 3 where the main fly doesnt shoot, but when all flies are dead, the boss enters his main
phase

have the same sprite as frostknuckle but he uses his shield like captain america or royal champion
