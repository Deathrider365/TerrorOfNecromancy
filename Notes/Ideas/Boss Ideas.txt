boss that latches on and absorbs life or maybe magic and it would actually heal the boss for as long as you are 
latched and the only way off is with a light weapon (probably a bonus boss or enemy, maybe a dungeon boss)

boss where there is a ray of light moving around the room which may be unlocked throughout the dungeon and the 
only way to beat this boss is to wait for the light to hit a reflector which enlightens the room killing the boss


a boss who's life is linked to a timer and the only way to kill him is to avoid him and not let him devour 
\spawning enemies which give him health and if he does hit you or absorb the spawning enemies he is healed, 
he is impervious to your attacks except maybe you can stun him or something

a fast pased boss that does 3 fast warps around the room, and on the third appears right by link 
and swings at him (with build up) and he does this constantly

phantom from the messenger is in the game. In his search to revive Muse, his lover, he come across the necromancer whom
he hears can bring back those who had died. He tasks phantom to kill link in order to help him. 
he will have all the same attacks, sfx, and boss music from the messenger. Have him refer to whatever it was he needed
to get to the music box or whatever since this is before he is trapped there. Have the music that plays outside his boss room play
when you enter the room where you encounter him. and have the sound of hitting him be the same as from the game, basically
mimic to messenger entirely. This will replace the hall of memories from IoR. 

Level 1 boss name: Amalgamation of Decay ---   ---

the boss (that is essentially going to be my stan) the first phase he is chained and the goal is to
break him free so you can eliminate him

How a deathrider boss that actually is a thing. perhaps he is just a normal legionnaire but somewhere
you find out that that particular legionnaire was rumored to have been from another realm where he
served under an emperor (referring to FFII)

essentially a patra 3 where the main fly doesnt shoot, but when all flies are dead, the boss enters his main
phase

have the same sprite as frostknuckle but he uses his shield like captain america or royal champion

A boss where you drop into the boss arena and you have to activate the boss but perhaps there is a way
to deal massive damage right away by activating him a specific way

a boss like IT from Promised lands where you have to light torches, each torch lights the room up a little more, once
all are lit he falls from the sky

Ahriman sprite from Promised Lands

Robot sentry guardian sentinal sprite from Promised Lands

Boss conjures a fireball, that is thrown at the ground and explodes into a bunch of smaller fireballs
that leaves fire around the arena

A dragon that during the first half of the fight it is climbing around the walls and has attacks
such as fire, claws, and even the ability to grab or bite link

(Thinking of the Dust Flyer or Ahriman sprite) flies around link (arena is atop a mountain) and does multiple
ranged attack and can even grab and drop link for massive damage

basically that poison and fire dragon from how to train your dragon, an enemy with 2 heads (or 2 different enemies)
one layes a poison and the other ignites it. You take damage from the poison in the fashion of umbral cloud's sun,
but once ignites it you are on fire causing a DOT

basically a recreation of nightmare with the phasing, time manipulation, and music

a two sided boss where (he could have 2 heads and turns around or something (think ashura from FFIV)) it swaps sides,
each with its own weaknesses and invulnerbilities and this could be the boss of the dungeon where you get that
multi-element wand or something

have deadhand with 2 phases, first phase is exactly like OoT, but then you fall down a hole and he is hanging from the
ceiling
