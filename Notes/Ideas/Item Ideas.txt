have the mirror shield reflect only magic and light, and have the holy shield reflect all things

where the necromancer dies (the location where he essentially jumps out of his tower be where you acquire the spectral cane maybe

for the item that reacts to the legionnaire rings (basically the blessed star), 
you get this from a guy that says he had been studying the undead legion and fasioned an item
that tells you when to flee (of course it isnt used like that)

the blue and red (or maybe just the gold armor) armor will have lore, being made from the 
legionnaires of old back when they were honorable and was the armor their knights wore.

Trading sequence splits off into 2 sequences (perhaps you get 2 of one item and each goes to someone) one path leads to a great item,
the other leads to a triforce piece (of death as to keep it optional).

Wind Waker bait bag, different baits for different reasons 

Double magic is a big deal like it is in GS

An elemental rod that can change elements and have different effects on the environment (ice freezes,
lightning stuns, fire does a DOT)

portal sphere (change name probably) can be charged up for a power attack, can be reflected by mirrors, and enemies will be able
to shoot those shots (perhaps a light sphere and dark sphere or perhaps a lvl 1 and lvl 2)

portable dock

levels 1 and 2 ladder, lvl 1 can be wooden and lvl 2 can be metal where it can go over firy combos the other can only
do water and gaps

when getting repetitive items like dungeon keys and whatnot, instead of the typical all freezing message, have a small
pop up in the corner saying +1 small key or something (may be able to use my status indicator for that, like, make
an obtained map/compass/boss key/small key status
