a dungeon where you raise and lower lava as opposed to water, and once lowered the lava could have
eaten away at stuff that was weak before and now can be accessed. To deal with people being able 
to do things they missed just make a trigger that they can only hit once they have everything 
creating a "point of safe no return"

a dungeon where you dive through caverns and perhaps items that can be used during that like in OOT

Have a tunnel leading to the hellish final dungeon, and have it play "The Dream of Jacob" or "Ne Natura Soronis No.1"

Have a dungeon that is full of poison or something toxic, could say that it was a building or 
something that had become corrupted by some toxin found in the ground or that it was a factory where 
everyone inside died (and are now enemies because ya know, the necromancer) and there is a lot of toxic stuffs

have a thing similar to the tower of wisdom from DtT+


each of the temple of the goddesses are dungeons and upon beating the bosses of each of those 
dungeons all of the enemies will be cleared (perhaps some of those enemies may drop a rare item 
and if you beat the boss before obtaining it it will be unobtainable, heart rings perhaps since i 
said i do not want any heart ring upgrades, this can be a way to have them but have them be rare) 
and the theme of that temple will change, perhaps to "Final Fantasy II - Ancient Castle"

a dungeon called dungeon of despair where there are woeful npc ghosts

Dungeon called: Ocean View Temple
