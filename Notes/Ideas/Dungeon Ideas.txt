a dungeon where you raise and lower lava as opposed to water, and once lowered the lava could have
eaten away at stuff that was weak before and now can be accessed. To deal with people being able 
to do things they missed just make a trigger that they can only hit once they have everything 
creating a "point of safe no return"

a dungeon where you dive through caverns and perhaps items that can be used during that like in OOT

Have a tunnel leading to the hellish final dungeon, and have it play "The Dream of Jacob" or "Ne Natura Soronis No.1"

Have a dungeon that is full of poison or something toxic, could say that it was a building or 
something that had become corrupted by some toxin found in the ground or that it was a factory where 
everyone inside died (and are now enemies because ya know, the necromancer) and there is a lot of toxic stuffs

have a thing similar to the tower of wisdom from DtT+


each of the temple of the goddesses are dungeons and upon beating the bosses of each of those 
dungeons all of the enemies will be cleared (perhaps some of those enemies may drop a rare item 
and if you beat the boss before obtaining it it will be unobtainable, heart rings perhaps since i 
said i do not want any heart ring upgrades, this can be a way to have them but have them be rare) 
and the theme of that temple will change, perhaps to "Final Fantasy II - Ancient Castle"

a dungeon called dungeon of despair where there are woeful npc ghosts

Dungeon called: Ocean View Temple

Dungeon called Great Pyramid or something where there is a switch in four corners on each level needed to proceed to next level

A whole map devoted to the area where the final bonus dungeon is and it will be full of legionnaires that wont hurt you until you
attack one of them or step on a grave or some trigger, play OOT Ganon's tower theme

Dungeon similar to prismatic gate where there is a normal, fire, ice, and some fourth theme (maybe poison)

A dungeon where there is an npc that helps you along through the dungeon but is trying to kill you (luring you into
traps when seeming like trying to help and when you get to the final room he isnt there, you grab the triforce, but nothing happens.
so you leave the triforce room only to find him in the room, he transforms into the boss)

A secondsary idea to the previous one about the npc deceptively helping you through the dungeon, perhaps it can be like LTTP where
they arent necessarily bad and they get corrupted and their dialogue gets messed up as you go through and he ends up the boss

A dungeon where there is a whole portion of the dungeon blocked by an impassable waterfall going through multiple floors (perhaps
theme it like Sunken Basin) and you need to unlock level by level a thing that will block the water (maybe it will be a hydro dam
or something). Side Idea: perhaps once all levels are blocked the pressure causes it to blow resulting in a hole somewhere from
the force of the now rushing water causing a hole somewhere in the dungeon containing a path to a hidden area of the overworld

Refer to my Region Ideas for the theme of level 1

floating castle FF1 aesthetic and music


Desert structure will be a dungeon called Level #: Mortuary of Corruption

Level #: The Deep of Dwarrodelf will be an ancient lava filled goron city in a mountain where there is a
notorious dragon inside

Dawn to Twilight Plus Deep Darkness theme
