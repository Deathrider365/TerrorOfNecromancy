Think that floors of combat from Wind Waker, there will be multiple pits to fall in leaving you in a different part
of the room, and you can have a hard time falling into say, a smaller part (think there is a left and right pit,
the floor below you has lava, and the left side has less walkability than the right side so you have to choose
wisely) (maybe even fall on spikes idk)
