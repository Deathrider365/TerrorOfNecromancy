Use "Final fantasy 4,The After Years - Epilogue" for credits music

if I have a room with a lot of poison or something (maybe make that a dungeon theme) play 
"Metroid Prime Music - Metroid Prime Boss Theme" this theme during it

Use the main tallon overworld theme for the outside of the Island of Haeren and use the tallon 
overworld 2 for the caves of the island

For final boss dialogue cut scene play "24-Golbez, Clad in the Dark-FFIV DS OST"

use wind waker miniboss theme for a miniboss theme

music from the end of star wars episode 6 be the end credits theme
