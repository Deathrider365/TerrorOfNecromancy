there was a war between the Dark Legion (called undead legion because they were destroyed by the goddess but still
managed to do bad things idk) and hyrule, and there is a prison on the island where the ancient hylian soldiers 
were held (this can be a shadown temple of sorts) and it took the goddesses to stop them
