Pernicious Carnivorous Abomination
	  ~~~Hazarond~~~

- General Theme:
	- Shoots oil around the room 
	  that will persist until a flame is dropped on it, 
	  burning it for x amount of time until vanishing

	- Cannot hurt boss until heads are all dead,
	  when all heads are dead it just runs around to try not to get hit, 
	  will dive into center pool to regen them

	- As he walks he lays down a combo for pushed in ground (mini crater), 
	  but below the layer he sprays his oil
	
- When With Heads:
	~Movement~
	- Walks slowly towards link, does not walk into or over the pool, will go around

	~Attacks~
	- Ground Pound: While link is close enough to hit the heads 
			he will attempt to stomp link by jumping (half way up the screen) onto link's position 
			doing an AOE attack dealing 1 heart of damage

	- Oil Cannon: Sprays oil at link's location for 4 seconds
		      deals 1/4 heart to link and reduces his speed by 25%, 
		      expires in 4 seconds from the last time he was hit by the cannon (not ground oil)

	- Oil Spray: Leaps into the center pool, 
		     charges for a moment (sfx & flashing | shaking), 
		     then spins 720 deg shooting oil around him convering the majority of the arena 
		     (same effect to link as Oil Cannon)

	- Flame Toss: as he is wandering the area the heads will randomly spit a flame from one of the heads
		      which will do 1/2 heart of damage 
		      and recursively ignite any oil it comes in contact with

	- Flame Spray: He stops,
		       shoots a flame out of each head 3 times consecutively 

	- Flame Cannon: Leaps away from link, 
			charges for a second or two, 
			then lobs ~10 flames at link in succession with 1 second of time between each shot 
			ending with a 2x2 large flame

	~Other Behavior~
	- >45% HP: As stated above
	- <45% HP: All clock related fields increased by 40%

- When Heads Destroyed:
	~Movement~
	- Fast and frantic for 5 seconds, can be injured, stays away from link and will escape from corners
	- Every 2 seconds randomly each head will drop oil from the head socket (as though it were bleeding)
	~Attacks~
	- None, just contact damage

-When Done Fleeing
	- Stops for a second, 
	  then leaps same height as the Ground Pound into the center pool (causing a wave that pushes link away) 
	  stays completely submerged for 4 seconds, 
	  will regen 20% of HP, 
	  he rises from the pool 
	  causing a wave that will push link away so he cannot be hit during his rise, 
	  continue from "When With Heads"
