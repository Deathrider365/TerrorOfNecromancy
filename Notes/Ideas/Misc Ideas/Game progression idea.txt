There will be a neutral, good, and bad ending. Neutral if you have <4 shard of death. Good if you collected all 4 shard and cleansed the triforce at temple of haeren, 
and bad if you collected all 4 and didnt cleanse, link gets corrupted… So…                                                                                       

“Neutral ending: the triforce of haeren remains incomplete, never to be revered again…”
“Good ending: the triforce of life has been restored, the land of Vita is restored”
“Bad ending: the triforce of death continues its existance of a tool of evil as link becomes corrupted and continues what the necromancer started and returns to 
   dominate the land of interitus…”
