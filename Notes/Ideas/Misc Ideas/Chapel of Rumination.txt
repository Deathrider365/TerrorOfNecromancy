"It is said that those who underwent a terrible past and wish to be rid of their heinous 
actions, always find themselves, in one way or another, at the Chapel of Rumination"
		- Some priest looking NPC

<Requirement to unlock the entire paladin set>

The Chapel of Rumination is similar to Hall of Memories from IoR, but has a much deeper lore and
impact on how the peoples of Vita deal with dark thoughts and actions

You enter the chapel, and are faced with a priest, upon defeating Right Hand, as well as everyone
and everything throughout the game, you are filled with a sense of dread and despair. You hear
of a chapel where you face your demons (quite literally) to overcome your doubt and guilt, to truly,
unlock the path towards good and riteousness. 

You enter the confessional as the priest urges you, and upon reflection, you are teleported to a
dream-esc version of every main level boss you fought throughout the game (like how HoM was a
grayscale generic room for every boss, these rooms will literally be the rooms you fought those
bosses in, just with washed out colors)

Upon defeating all of the bosses, you will refight Right Hand. Granting the Holy Mail

Beating him on Paladin Mode will unlock the ability to fight (perhaps tartaros or some other demon
I make (tartaros would be an amazing cameo)) which can either grant another holy piece or some
other useful item 

This is all meant to be completed after the final dungeon and upon defeating the final boss,
but before the Crypt of the Undead Legion (or whatever i call it, basically the one main (perhaps
there will be other) post game dungeon, reflective of Blighted Abyss).
