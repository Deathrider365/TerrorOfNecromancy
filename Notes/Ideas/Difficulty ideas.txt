Have a paladin mode, similar to hero mode, where you get all of the holy gear off the bat but their 
effectiveness is slightly worse and the entire game is harder with a slightly different story

You will have 3 extra lives given that can be used upon death like fairies. their counter will be in 
the submenu and upon death if you have lives remaining, you will be prompted to choose if you want to 
use one. once all 3 are gone, you do not get them back ever. And these revives will revive link where 
he died like how fairies are in the 3d zeldas
