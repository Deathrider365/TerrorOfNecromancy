Give a name to the world instead of "the world" also I do not want islands, keep it to 2, maybe 3 islands

I will create a video to play for the intro:

Think of the Fellowship of the Ring intro for the tone of this intro

Narrative:
All know how all things came into being, for all was created by the Goddesses; Din, Farore, and Nayru.

-----<show OoT scene of them flying or whatever>-----

They are the deities that created the sacred Triforce,

-----<show the triforce>-----

the tools for good to keep the world at peace,

-----<similar to FFII show scenes of peace>-----

but of course, there is always evil that covets this divine tool. 

-----<show dramatic evils through out zelda games>-----

All throughout history there was the good and the evil constantly opposing eachother, vying for the power of the triforce to shape the world how they saw fit. 

-----<show zelda boss fights>-----

In most cases the good one, but in many, evil found a way 

-----<show scenes of ganon winning>-----

This is well known. However, there was a fourth... Those three goddesses; Din, Farore, and Nayru, are the ones that physically created the world, but, there is also Jaanusi, The Goddess of beginnings, transitions, time, duality, and endings.

-----<link to Janus (actual mythology): https://tinyurl.com/veob4ld>-----

The three primary goddesses created the land and all who populated it, but it was Jaanusi's duty to maintain the order of organic beings, to keep the circle of life in balance. For a time all was well in balance. The living did not fear Jaanusi, but rather welcomed her embrace when their time on the physical plane had come to an end. However, the primary goddesses became jelouse, for Jaanusi was recieving the praise for all that was good since she was the mosts active and well known. So, the primaries formulated a plan, one that would put them back on top of the praise heriarchy. They would corrupt Jaanusi, make her suffer. Their plan succeeded, she became twisted, confused, and forgot all that was good about her.

In her corrupted state she began terrorizing the good peoples that once worshiped her, taking those that they loved unexpectedly and manipulated them, abusing her power. In time she adopted a new more well known name; Anubis, Thanatos, Apophis

-----<link to apophis (actual mythology): https://tinyurl.com/wfutfl8>-----

The primary goddesses did not realize how much destruction that the once good goddess would cause, and even they came to fear her. For since they were all sacred goddesses, they could not control her, she was their equal, and they themselves were powerless. 

Eventually, they had a plan. They planned to take on the most riteous, purest people they could find, and send them through a trial to see if they be worthy and courageous enough, to take down Apophis. 

For centuries, as Apophis terrorized the world, finding a champion seemed to be impossible, the primary goddesses feared all hope was lost. The peoples of the world have become cold, cynical, deluded. Most that remained didn't even ackowledge the names Din, Farore and Nayru to be worth knowing. A world where the dead roam, those they once loved empty, mindless, all at the hands, of the Necromancer.

-----<commence, intro to the game>-----

-----<voice of the goddesses>-----
Link, link awaken.

-----<wakes up animation>-----
Link, do not fear, you are in safe hands. We are the Goddesses, though you may not recognize us. We are the goddesses that created the world, we are Din, Nayru, and Farore. We have scoured the world for one that has a pure heart, and unmatched courage to help us with our pleight. Undoubtedly you know the name Apophis. She is our twisted sister goddess, orgininally purposed with maintaining the world and keeping life in balance, but she has become corrupt, using her powers of necromancy to terrorize the world that was once good. 

Link, we believe you may be courageous enough, to pass our trial, and save the world. If we are wrong, then all hope is lost, and our once radiant power will diminish. Link, you must succeed in passing our trial, for if you do, you may have what it takes to save all of creation.

Your task is to rid our temple of the evil plaguing it, you will find equipment lying around the isles to aid you on your journey. Once you rid our temple, we will reveal your task in full, good luck link! You may find us at any of our statues for information if you find yourself lost, also there are healing resoviours that will replanish your body from any injuires, body and mind 

-----<the first statue will be a statue that will provide your current task in the game, to prevent getting lost, the other is obviously a fairy spot, make custom tiles for the info statue>-----


----------------------------------------------------------- Phase 1: Temple of the Goddesses-----------------------------------------------------------


-----<Link will then play through what is essentially the ToN Mini quest, obviously with a different boss and everything will be nerfed, once the boss is beaten and the temple and island in cleansed, there will be a cutscene of the decrepid temple and isles being cleansed>-----

Link! You have succeeded in cleansing the isle and our temple of the undead that plagued it! We will now fill you in on everything you need to know.

Each of us <showing din, farore, and nayru> have a holy triforce, inbued with our power, and if someone with a pure heart, with pure intentions obtains all three, Power, Wisdom, Courage, they will usher the world into an era of light. Although if they have evil intentions, the world will enter an era of darkness. Link, your task is to obtain all 3 triforce and use their power to vanquish Apophis. Currently, each of our triforce are split into 3 fragments in order to reduce the likeliness of anyone reforming all of the triforces. Each fragment is well hidden throughout the land. But do not freat, we will guide you as you journey on. 

Now link, head back to the temple, and take your raft to the dock in there to head over to the mainland to the east, there we will make contact again. Farewell, and remember, what good remains in this world is counting on you!


----------------------------------------------------------- Phase 2: Isle of Emperium, lvl 1-3 -----------------------------------------------------------


-----<link arrives on the first overworld, near the start is a tablet where Din talks to link>-----

Link, you have arrived on Emperium, once a lushious land, now dripping in the blood of the innocent. It is here where the fragments of my triforce, the triforce of Power, reside. Each fragment will be found in strongholds present here. Beware link, Apophis does not know of the whereabouts of my triforce fragments, so her minions are hunting it as well. It would be best for you to tread lightly, for you do not want to draw too much attention. Oh, one final thing to mention; each of us has enough power to save you once, so if you find yourself nearing death, you may call upon us to save you, but know, each of us only has enough power to protect you once, after we are expended, well lets hope it wont come to that. Good luck Link! We will be watching you!

-----<there will be various NPCs across the land with their own dialogue not stated in the story dialogue, giving tidbits about things like in IoR>-----

-----<level 1>-----

-----<level 2>-----

-----<upon the death of the boss of level 3, from the voice of Din>-----

Link! You have done it! you have obtained all the fragments of my triforce! Now, return to our temple to reassemble the Triforce of Power!

-----<interrupted by Apophis like a hologram from star wars>-----

Ahh, so you are the one I have heard about, going around trying to reassemble the triforces. Nothing is hidden from me, in MY world. I will have to relieve you of those fragments, <insert name> will destroy you!

-----<this fight is similar to lvl 9 venser you are intended to die but if you dont...>-----

-----<you win, voice of <insert name>>-----

No! This is not possible! I have destroyed many of your kind with ease!! How is this possible!!

-----<Apophis warps him out to save him and says>-----

This is not over child! You may have those wretched goddesses to save you now, but their power is depleating by the day, they wont be able to keep you safe for long!

-----<this will grant something such as weakening this boss for when you fight him for real at the very end of the game, or perhaps obtaining an item that makes him easier>-----

-----<you lost, voice of <insert name>>-----

Just as I expected, there are none that can challenge me! I shall take this triforce back to my lord, I will let you live, mayhaps you will grant me future enjoyment!

-----<you lose all 3 fragments of the triforce of Power ~~~~~Begin Branch 1: ending with the death of <insert name> who in this fight is much weaker~~~~~>-----

-----<link lays in the boss room, voice of Din>-----

Link do not fret, you did your best which is all we can ask of you, but you must stop him before he delivers the fragment of my triforce to Apophis. there is a fortress through a narrow pass that you can intercept him at, head <insert direction relative to level 3> to the fortress and stop him!

-----<you get to this fortress, and when you confront <insert name>>-----

You again?! HAHAHA, great! More fun for me! Prepare to meet my lord in the afterlife with your people!

-----<you beat him here but he does not die, use dialogue from the you win part previous but with this branch you get no bonus reward>-----

-----<you keep all 3 fragments of the triforce of Power ~~~~~Begin Branch 2: continues the story, branch 1 ends where this begins~~~~~>-----

Link! You must return to our temple to reassemble the Triforce of Power!

-----<you go back to the first temple, voice of Din>-----

Place the fragment on the <will decide this area>

-----<cutscene for reassembling the triforce of power where you obtain din's fire and <custom item related to power, enhanced if you beat <instert name> first try>>-----


----------------------------------------------------------- Phase 3: Isle of Sapientiae, lvl 4-6 -----------------------------------------------------------


-----<voice of Farore>-----

With the Triforce of Power in hand you must journey to Sapientiae, home to most of the knowledge and scholars. Head to <enter direction somewhere to the west>

-----<you head to the west to Sapientiae, then cutscene with Nayru>-----

Welcome to Sapientiae. As we mentioned eariler this was home of all knowledge that was recorded since the beginning of time. The majority of the inhabitants were scholars, their focus was understanding all that exists. Just as with Din, you must obtain the three fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom and return the fragments to out temple. Good luck Link!

-----<level 4>-----

-----<level 5>-----

-----<between level 5 and 6 you encounter another of Apohpis's generals>-----

-----<you encounter a scholar that triggers a cutscene>-----

Are you the one attempting to assemble the goddess's triforce? I must urge you to stop, you are ignorant to what will happen once all of the fragments are joined together. You think you will have the ability to stop the Necromancer, but nothing can stop her. Nothing, except the empty space between...

-----<the scholar is killed from a black arrow and there is a cutscene where he is killed>-----

-----<level 6, there is a cutscene with Nayru upon the death of the boss of level 6>-----

We are very greatful that you have managed to obtain the triforce of wisdom. Return to our temple to restore its' power.

-----<cutscene same as the last but with the triforce of wisdom>-----


----------------------------------------------------------- Phase 4: Isle of Aanimo, lvl 7-9 -----------------------------------------------------------


-----<you arrive on Aanimo, voice of farore>-----

You have arrived on Aanimo. Something you need to know is to stay away from the graveyard here, to get to the fragments you dont need to pass through it and it is extremely dangerous. That graveyard is the home of the Undead Legion, the elite army of Apophis, they are the last thing you want to encounter here. Now, head to the <direction and or location> to capture the fragments of the triforce of courage

-----<the undead legion is the post game and you can enter the graveyard right now but cannot do anything until the end of the trading sequence. the enemies here are very very difficult>-----

-----<link goes in the dirction stated to the next island>-----

-----<level 7>-----

-----<level 8>-----

-----<level 9, same kind of cutscene saying you got the triforce fragments yadda yadda yadda>-----

-----<on the trip back to the temple while you have all 3 triforces something happens>-----

-----<you are attacking on your way back by a sea monster that is a servant of Apophis and you fight it resulting in 2 branches>-----

-----<Branch 1: you lose>-----

The Leviathan devours you like in FFIV, and you end up on a small island with a mini dungeon that takes you where you were supposed to go, but the events here limit events later on

-----<Branch 1: you beat the Leviathan>-----

the events of the game go as normal and you end at the main island

-----<you arrive at the temple of the goddesses>-----

You have done it Link! You have reassembled all of our triforce!


----------------------------------------------------------- Phase 5: Isle of Rebirth lvl 10-13 -----------------------------------------------------------


Link, we may not have been entirely truthful with everything that you would have to do to take down Apophis. There is more than just the 3 triforce, there is a fourth. As you know the triforce is the manifistations of us, containing our power when we left this world. The same is true for Apophis. Her triforce was once known as the Triforce of Life, now with her corruption it has become the Triforce of Death, but if you could manage to obtain it, there is a chance that your pure heart can cleanse it, giving you the power to vanquish her. Her triforce remains intact on <insert place>. Be wary, you may have the power of all of our triforce but Apophis is dangerous, and she has her triforce under heavy guard. Also that land belongs to her so we wont be of much assistance. Be careful.

-----<level 10, very difficult, like how level 8 ramped up difficulty>-----

-----<link heads through the dark lands and finds the location of her triforce and when you beat the boss...voice of Apophis and she appears for the first time>-----

Not possible! How could a mere child reassemble the golden triforces?! Then you have the audacity to attempt to capture mine? NO! You will never posses my power! 

-----<she splits her triforce in 3 and 3 of her underlings take the fragments to their domains>-----

You may be wondering why I would take the same action as the golden goddesses, well, I own this world and those are my most trusted guardians, there is no conceivable way you can even get TO them, let alone defeat them!

-----<level 11>-----

-----<level 12>-----

-----<level 13>-----

-----<the boss of this dungeon is a familiar of Apophis, it will have some of the attacks that the final boss will have>-----


----------------------------------------------------------- Phase 6: Endgame, lvl 14 -----------------------------------------------------------

-----<after obtaining the Triforce of Death, and returning to the temple of the goddesses, the big statue at the top depicting the 3 goddesses crumbles to show the fourth, and the death triforce remains dark, you need to cleanse Apophis before cleansing her triforce since it IS her power>-----

-----<you go to the final dungeon, once you get to the boss room, in her #2's voice (which is the boss that was in level 3 that had 2 branching paths, and if you beat him first try he is easier since you will have that item) because they are both in the room>-----

We have been expecting you Link. After you regained the first fragment of the Triforce of Death we knew there was no use in relying on incompetence, which is why we have been here, luring you to your demise, our trap.

-----<the ground opens up and link is swallowed, her #2 follows>-----

Look at you, and insignificant worm that has somehow managed to do the impossible. Unfortunately, you have been decieved this entire time, those so called "golden goddesses" are not what they seem. THEY are the reason Apophis is who she is, she was once known as Jaanusi, the Goddess of Life. But, those goddesses were jealous of her praise, so they corrupted her, turning her into the being she is now. Now, you will give me all 4 triforce you possess, so I may return the grace of Jaanusi. 

-----<link gets a decision, if you give the 4 to him, you get the bad ending because he uses the power of the 4 to kill you and Apophis, becomeing an even worse abomonation, instant game over>-----

Yes, yesssss, YESSSS. YOU FOOL!! then ^ happens

-----<when choosing no>-----

No? Well now I see your true colors, you do not want peace, you want to dominate the world yourself!! Time for you to see my true might, our fight <in level 3> was me in my weaker state, Apophis has granted me power beyond even my knowledge, I shall make quick work of you!

-----<you beat him, if you dont then you die as you would. Once beaten you mak your way to the big room where you fell from, Apophis isnt there>-----

-----<you leave the dungeon to find Apophis, she has the golden goddesses bound up in dark magic, when she notices your presence>-----

I figured that kiss up would not manage to defeat you, you have all 4 triforce afterall. You may be wondering why I do not fear the one who managed to completely annihilate all of my forces. Well it is quite simple actually, those triforce get their power from those that materialized them; and these "golden goddesses" will not be around long enough for you to use their power, and of course mine is useless to you, cant use my power against me. With these 3 gone those triangles are useless! Now say farewell to your precious goddesses!!

-----<she proceeds to "vanquish" the goddesses and the light eminating from the 3 triforces diminish>-----

Ha, haha, HAHAHAHA!! Finally!! They are gone forever. Now, to destroy the last remnant of them, YOU!

-----<during this fight the goddess gems and the custom items are useless, all except the death triforce items which do nothing to her>-----

-----<she beats you, this isnt supposed to be a destruction but there is no beating her and like with venser in level 7 your health can only go down to 1/4 heart>-----

HAHAHA! I knew you were not all what you seem, when alone your are helpless. You were just a tool of the goddesses, without them you are nothing. I almost wouldnt event want to kill you, just so you can live in a world you failed to save. Sadly you have done so much damage to MY world that I cannot let you live, Goodbye "hero".

-----<she "kills" you, taking you to a mysterious land, after walking one direction for so long, you find the golden goddesses>-----

-----<voice of the goddesses, they alternate who talks>-----

Goddess 1: Link, I see you have failed to defeat Apophis, that is understandable considering she banished us.
Goddess 2: We are sorry for everything, we know you found out about everything, about Jaanusi. We understand if you question us and whether we really are trying to do good
Goddess 3: We assure you, we regreted our decision to corrupt Jaanusi, we wish we could take everything back. But this is why we needed you Link, you can help us rewrite out wrongs.
Goddess 1: You may be wondering where we are. We are not in "heaven" and you mortals think exists. We are where we divines go when banished, this is not where ordinary mortals go when they die. The reason you are here is because you have been in such close contact with the power of the triforce that you were sent here.
Goddess 2: This does not mean that you cannot die, but rather you ahev absorbed enough energy that you must have had enough to send you here, but as it happens you are drained significantly and will be forced to either retreat and heal, or you may be killed.
Goddess 3: This is why we left the world, we had used so much of our energy that we had to leave and heal. So link, you will return to the mortal realm, and Apophis will encounter you again. So we will give you everything we have left so that you can defeat her.

-----<they join together and fill your dark triforce with their power, returning their light, you then return to the mortal realm where you collapsed, Apophis is shocked>------

Wha-what? How are you still alive?!?! And the triforce is lit, b-b-but I destroyed them!! No matter! I beat you once I can do it again!!

-----<<this is the big final boss>>-----

-----<<<<when beating the final boss and having the credits and all that, have the game save before the big fight so people can get both endings without playing the entire game twice>>>>>-----

-----<there are 2 options from here on out, you can either destroy/seal (idk which yet) Apophis, or defeat her and restore her, giving 2 endings, depends on how you beat her, you can either just attack until dead, or when she does her "down on a knee" animation just before she dies you use the power of the golden goddesses to cleanse her, transforming her triforce of death back into the triforce of Life, showing a complete golden triangle with no dark center. 

-----<this is the killing her ending>-----

-----<she collapses, then vanishes. the goddess come out of the triforce and speak>-----

You have done it! She has fallen, and her hold on the world is beinging to fade! You Like are the hero of the world!

-----<you then return to the temple of the goddesses, with the three golden and the one dark, and place them on their pedestal, the game fades to the end credits which shows the peoples of the world rejoicing as the undead fall to their permanant death>-----

-----<this is the saving her ending, after cleansing her and her triforce, she awakens and has no memory of her henious acts>-----

Wha-what happened? I feel as though, I have been in a terrible nightmare. 

-----<the goddesses reveal themselves from their triforces>-----

You? what are all of you doing here? Why are we in such a dark decripid place? Wait a minute, I remember now, you three were <she remembers them corrupting her, essentiall whatever act that was>. How could you do that?? Wait, did it succeed? did I cause this? I can feel, such terrible anguish and death, ugh it hurts! I must go and fix this!

-----<the golden goddesses explain everything the Jaanusi>-----

I forgive you for what you all have done, you regret your decision and have saved me from myself. Link, I am terribly sorry for al I have done, and the pain I have caused. It is time I fix this, I must return this world to what it was supposed to be!

-----<the credit commence depicting the land you went through all lushious and green, the people are happy, and the credits end with Jaanusi returning to her triforce and in the temple of the goddesses, the fully golden triforce is on its pedetal, and link walks out, fade to black>-----
