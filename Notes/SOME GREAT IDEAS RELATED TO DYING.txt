have an NPC being almost too clear about how dying too many times will result in the player being unable to complete some aspects of the game

reference dark souls and how as the living die, they begin to hollow, losing their humanity. and of course the bonus content related to gather a full set of Holy equipment, you cannot get that unless you have a low enough "hollowing" 

<npc dialogue>
"ya know, I have read a book about a world that always had the impending doom of going dark, and in order to save the world and keep the light is that a champion would need to "link the fire", as it was referred to. I wonder if those rules apply to our world. Perhaps you should be careful to not find yourself in too perilous positions. Haha, not like you can do anything if you are dead but perhaps, if you find that happening, have it happen as little as you can. You never know if that can restrict things that you can do..."

perhaps the legion's tomb will still be accessible, like, perhaps killing the ending from that dungeon will depend on how many deaths the player had. 

<50 you get a "noo, i cannot be obliterated by a child of such holy light. NOOO"

>50 you get a "Noo! why does someone of such hollowness have so much power!?! At least, from you at least, I cannot be destroyed!!" fade away with laughter playing
