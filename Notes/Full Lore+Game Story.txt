//~~~~~ Prologue ~~~~~//
   In ancient times unknown, there was a thriving kingdom on the island of Vita, named after the purity of life granted by the goddess Haeren. With the Triforce of Life she had full 
control over life and death, making life on the island a near paradise by her graces. The lord of the kingdom was intelligent and mindful, always making the best decisions for the 
kingdom. However, he coveted the power that Haeren controled and soon hatched a plan to seize her power for himself.

   He ordered the Brigadier of his Legion of Knights, Aemulor, and his legion to capture Hearen's Triforce and take over the island, and eventually vanquish Haeren. 
With the cunningness of Aemulor, he led his legion to victory, capturing the Triforce from the goddess, and hid it deep within a remote hidden base.
Almost immediately her power started to drain, as the Triforce, being in the hands of those with such darkness, was tainting the purity of the Triforce. 
She, along with the good people of the island, pleaded to the king to find the unknown thieves, and return the Triforce. He agreed, and with many of his guards he sent her on a wild 
goose chase, to give him time to spend on learning the power of the Triforce.

   Not long soon after, given that Aemulor's main task was keeping the Triforce hidden, and the king spending much of his time managing the kingdom, gave rise to an unprecedented 
opportunity to Aemulor. In his time guarding the Triforce he learned far more than the king did, and began practicing the powers it granted, learning what would eventually be coined 
as "Necromancy". Taking those that already had passed on and reviving them in darkness, resulting in a twisted demonic shade of the original being. It did not take the king long to 
see that Aemulor was far more knowledgeable with the power of the Triforce. Despite Aemulor swearing complete allegience to the king, the king was uneasy with the situation. 

   Eventually Aemulor became so attuned to the power of the Triforce that he was able to sense materials on the island of Vita that could reveal the life force of living beings, which would give him
a better grasp of their being for ease of manipulation. As a result he ordered one of his Colonels, Servus Malus, to scour the island in search of the rare material. Unfortunately for him there was
only one reliable source, in the Krahzen mountains on the northern coast of Vita. As it was a rare material, not much was found and the material was not one that was easily molded, not even Aemulor 
could mutate it. Therefore he captured the best smiths on the island, a small family that had already made most of the island's weapons and armor, to work with it. They succedded in mutating 
it, giving Aemulor the ability to create talismens that could reveal to him the lifeforce of most living things around him.

   It was time to make a move, Aemulor's power had peaked, being able to effortlessly exert his intentions on nearly any living and non living being on Vita, it was time to seize the kingdom and overthrow
the king. The king, already having suspicion that Aemulor would attempt a coup, was ready and had his castle fortified to the highest degree. During the siege, the king could see his soldiers stood
no chance, as not only was Aemulor powerful, but he enhanced his legion. Bearing new armor and weapons infused with darkness under the name Undead Legion, as they were all enhanced living dead soldiers 
that could not die unless Aemulor deemed it so. The skirmish was swift, as Aemulor was able to control all of the king's fallen soldiers during the battle, increasing his numbers. Desperate, the king 
fled to Haeren, who had grown so weak from her Triforce not only being stolen, but corrupted. The king revealed his intentions led by jealosy, but vowed to reclaim her Triforce in her name. She was 
unable to assist, as she had never known humans to claim a Triforce and command it with such ferocity and accuracy.

   Haeren was powerless, only the other goddesses themselves could stop the coming apocalypse of the newly titled Necromancer Aemulor. Eventually the goddesses did come to the aid of the isolated island, 
and were able to contain Aemulor to the island of Vita. After a ferocious war that nearly obliterated the island, the goddesses were able to separate the Triforce from Aemulor, and removed it from the 
island, quickly draining Aemulor's power. The goddesses created a remote island that could not be sailed to by normal ships, one that was hidden in the middle of the ocean, and erected a temple designed 
to prevent anyone from claiming the Triforce and risking another global apocalypse. Unfortunately as her Triforce was mutated by Aemulor only a hero with a pure heart could cleanse it, resulting in Haeren 
herself diminishing before the eyes of the golden goddesses, barely able to communicate with the living plane. Simultaneously, Aemulor's power had also weakened greatly, the power he once controlled took 
a toll on his physical form, causing him and his forces to deteriorate. However, their spirits were volatile and resiliant and would not leave the land, resulting in a dark corrupted blemish on the once 
beautiful island.

   The king, still king of Vita, swore to never again tamper with forces of the gods, isolating the dark side of the island and living out the rest of his days paranoid that he may see the dark arts performed 
once again. 

   Ages passed, the king's decendents slowly found themselves unable to properly rule the land, resulting in a power vacuum that would be taken advantage of by residents that shared some of the darkness
permanently left being by the Necromancer Aemulor and his Undead Legion. Dark spirits roamed the lands, causing minor infractions amongst the people who were losing grace left behind by Haeren. 
The events unfolding on Hyrule, slowly found their way to Vita through the occassional sailing passerby visiting the forsaken land. Talk of heroes saving lands from evil circulated around the residents who 
so desperately needed a hero to return order and peace to their home, leading many to pray for such an adventurer would arrive... only to be disappointed. The Legend of the Calamity of Vita became the mythos of the 
people of Vita, the time the island was nearly destroyed by a once powerful evil that could topple gods and control life and death. So did the once worshipped shining silver Triforce of Hearen, 
of which, like the goddess, faded out of legend only to be vaguely referenced in ancient forgotten texts.
\\~~~~~ Prologue ~~~~~\\



\\~~~~~ The Scholar ~~~~~\\
   Upon Link's eventual defeat of Ganon, 7 years after Ganon had abused the power of the Triforce of Power and taken over Hyrule, peace returned and would be rebuild from the tyranny of the dark lord.
It was at this time that a Hylian scholar who had been studying the Triforces of the three golden goddesses wanted to venture out and see the world. Perhaps it was the passing of the ages, or the evils 
of the world fading into obscurity, or even dumb luck that the impenetrable barrier sealing the Isle of Haeren had faded, and in the travels of the Hylian scholar the island was discovered. The scholar, 
with his sizable platoon, investigated the ancient decrepit island. There was a neutral but uneasy feeling to the island, like something lay sleeping waiting to be reawakened inside. The potency of the 
power that once coursed through the Triforce made it almost hypnotic to humans, and could very easily corrupt their hearts. Eventually the scholar, fighting through ancient ruined traps and grotesque monsters 
unlike that which they have ever seen, found the temple's antechamber chamber. 
   Upon entering he encountered a slumbering undead; An ancient hero chosen by Haeren, of whom she thought had a pure enough heart to restore the light within her Triforce. He had succumbed to the Triforce, 
and performed dark arts in the temple, even being able to use the darkness to summon ancient souls onto the island, most notable the soul of a member of the Undead Legion which acted as his personal guard. 
Unable to leave the encased island by the power of the golden three, knew that like himself, Haeren would attempt to summon another unsuspecting hero to cleanse the triforce. Over the ages he fell into a 
deep sleep inside the antechamber of the temple. Luckily for the scholar he was able to acquire the Triforce under the negligence of the ancient undead, escaping the island with an unexpected treasure. 
Returning to his ship he began his enthusiastic studies on the dark Triforce, as it was unheard of that there was a fouth one in existence. 

   In time the expedition found the Island of Vita. Hyrule was aware of the lands of Vita, but not much of it's history and status. The Hylians were welcomed with open arms, as the people and recent generations
have not known any symbols of authority or security. They pleaded with the soldiers to retake the ancient castle that once was the symbol of strength and prosperity of Vita. No more than a year later and the 
soldiers claimed the castle, as well as the various towers around the island to establish order, and snuff out any brigands and criminals. During this time of establishing order that the good soldiers of Hyrule 
enacted, gave the scholar a lot of time to get very familiar with the dark Triforce, but he could not seem to make anything of it. It layed dormant, like something or someone was holding the door shut, not allowing 
him in. He felt there had to be something on the island that could potentially awaken the Triforce given its close history with the island. He explored, ventured into the island following the feeling of dread left 
behind on the island with a small platoon of soldiers, as well as his adopted son Daserta. Daserta was an orphan that the scholar had mentored on hyrule, about the same age as Link, whom he had serving as his 
right hand, man.

   In their time following this unknown darkness, they came accross a secluded portion of the island that writhed with the darkness the scholar had been following. Clutching the darkened Triforce in his
hands, he entered the darkness. He found a treasure trove of artifacts forign to the scholar, ancient texts describing things that he had never heard of; 'necromancy'. Soon after poking through some
documents, the Triforce bursted from his grip filling the whole area with the darkness. As if a bomb went off, the Triforce reacted violently with the area around them. The darkness filled those present, 
like leeches grasping onto a host. After regaining their conciousness, the company left the ruins unsure of what happened and unaware of what they set in motion. Not long after returning to their home in the castle, 
the scholar was able to interact with the Triforce in ways he was not expecting, not only was the Triforce reacting to his will but it seemed to feel natural. He felt powerful, nothing like he felt with the 
other Triforces. Quickly he started playing around with his newfound powers. One night he summoned all that was in the company that led the expedition into the ruins. They all had felt the power of the Triforce, 
they all felt the connected darkness they had awakened. That night was plan to take full control over the island of Vita was made. 

   What followed was the making of history repeating itself. The scholar gives out his plans to his soldiers that they are to take full control over the island, and eliminate all that oppose by force. Many of the 
soldiers refused, as it went against their directive of exploring new lands and helping anyone in need. Those that opposed were either executed or fled the castle. Those that stayed were granted power by the Necromancer. 
With the new threat the Scholar presented, the soldiers that defected from the Scholar setup posts in the towns of Vita. They trained who they could to aid in the defense of the innocent, and readied for any incoming 
attacks. The Scholar had spent enough time with the Triforce to nearly efforlessly control the being around him, claiming the ancient title of Necromancer he had read in the texts of old. Daserta, serving ever still 
as the Necromancer's right hand, could sense the darkness growing within the man that had shown him kindness, but could not defy him as thoughts of such made him guilty and afraid to go against his wishes.

   With the Necromancer's power growing, and the power of Aemulor slowly reawakening, members of Aemulor's Undead Legion begin to rise up, as they heard their master's call through the Triforce of Death. The Necromancer, 
controlling them, orders his new legionnaires to train his most elite hylian guards in the combative ways of the ancient legion. After word of this Necromancer spread around the island, a messenger was sent back 
to Hyrule to inform the Hyrulian government that a grave threat is growing on the Island of Vita that could potentially pose a threat to the world. As a result Link and Zelda were sent out, having defeated Ganon and 
controlling the power of the golden Triforces, to stop the terror caused by Necromancer's terrible necromancy.
\\~~~~~ The Scholar ~~~~~\\



<<<GAME BEGINS>>>
   
   As Link and Zelda sail for the island now known as Interitus, they are encountered by a massive sea serpent known to legend as the Leviathan. They commence battle, eventually resulting in the Leviathan destroying their 
ship, sending all on board into the seas around Interitus. With the waning power of Haeren, she influenced Link's arrival on her secluded island. She explained that Link is the only one who could fix all that happened 
ages ago. That he could restore the light in her Triforce by returning the Triforce to her temple and with his pure heart, restoring the light within purging the evil that claimed it. However first, he would need to 
purge the darkness plaguing the temple.

<Mini Dungeon 1: Temple of Haeren>
~Amalgamation of Decay: ---Shambles---~
   Link defeats a powerful undead residing within the temple. The arrival of Link on the island as a result of Haeren's intervention awoke the ancient failed hero residing within the temple. He knew as he predicted that
the goddess would indeed summon a successor to him, which he could use to potentially escape the island. Shocking to him however, his source of power had been removed, reducing his powers substantially but given the dark
Triforce still held the potent darkness, was able to maintain control of his raised undead and called them into action and to take down this new hero.

   After defeating the shambled evil, Haeren gives Link means to leave the island in a raft left behind by the ancient fallen hero. She wishes Link success in his journey as he sails off to Interitus. While sailing to 
Interitus, he is encountered by the Leviathan once again who informs him that going to the island of Interitus is exactly what the Necromancer wants, as he and Zelda possess the other three Triforce, of which the Necromancer 
could combine the powers to become the most powerful god to ever exist. The Leviathan once again attacks Link with a massive tidal wave, but with the last of her power Haeren protects Link, and saftely gets him to Interitus. 
Link wakes up in a teepee on the eastern coast of Interitus, greeted by an old man who informs him of the situation on the island. The old man has knowledge of the events on Hyrule, as well as much of the recent history of 
Vita, giving him great insight. He even informs Link that the Triforce that came with He and Zelda were lost to the Necromancer's forces. Where the old man doesnt know directly how to help Link with his goal of stopping the 
Necromancer, he gives him guidance and peace of mind. He informs Link that it would be wise to start in the forest to the north of the nearby village of Viridi, as it has seen some supernatural events taking place and could 
be a good place to start. 
   After exploring around the nearby areas of the northeastern side of the island and talking with the locals, Link learns that one of the Necromancer's minions has awakened an ancient beast in a lair found deep within the 
Cumpura Forest. The ancient beast is known as the Hazarond, a monster that thrives in natural oils, and has the ability to breath fire to ignite the oils it excretes as a self defense mechanism. With one of Aemulor's many 
expeditions for the materials that grant the ability to sense the life force within beings, he came across this already ancient lair, and deemed it not worth the trouble, as even he did not want to discover it's wrath, 
as the oil-fire combination could cause untold damage to his forces, as they were all undead and highly flammable.

<<Level 1 - Pernicious Grotto>>
~Source of Corruption: ---Hazarond---~

   Link investigates the lair and learns of the Necromancer's follower that ventured into the grotto, learning more about the Hazarond, until he learns that the follow had be claimed by the ancient beast upon defeating it.
Link claims a shard of his Triforce of Courage within the grotto. Word gets around through the Necromancer's soldiers that as expected, Link and Zelda have arrived on the island, and Link has claimed one of the Triforce 
shards.

<Battle Arena 1: Racoon Hollow>
~Gargantuan Bandit of the Forest ---Overgrown Racoon---~ 

   Link ventures around more of the island and finds himself in the company of highly intelligent racoons. It is said in few obfuscated texts that with the grace of some ancient magic, even the animals were able to 
communicate with the peoples of Vita. While mostly confused, Link encounteres a guard that was once in the higher circles of the Necromancer's ranks, and hears of what the Necromancer was involved with. Hushed tones about 
something big, something even the Necromancer himself was wary of. Eventually, Link encounters a concerned father outside of an ancient abandoned mine. His son went into the mine to practice his archery on the Keese within, 
but with the Father having hurt himself, tasks Link to take his lantern and get his son out. 

<<Level 2: Derelict Quarry>>
~Colonel of Darkness ---Servus Malus---~

   Link finds the father's son, who gifts Link with his bow as well as the knowledge of a determined soldier, saying something about going deeper into the mine to take care of some long overdue business. Link finds his way 
into the depths of the mine and walks in on that soldier, yelling in an open room, accusing some being of mistreating his descendent. A spector reveals itself, the cursed spirit of Servus Malus, high ranking Colonel of Aemulor, 
tasked to find one of the rarest resources on the island. Outside of the control of the Colonel, the material was tapped in the Krahzen mountains making Servus unable to deliver what Aemulor wanted. As a result of the failure, 
he and all of his remaining miners were cursed by Aemulor to forever roam the tunnels of the mine never to have peace. Servus, still seething at this failure taunts the soldier. Seemingly proud of his cruelty and mistreatment 
of the miners that had failed him, he slanders the soldier's descendent, degrading him to ants digging insignificant tunnels. Link intervenes after Servus launches the soldier across the room with ease, incapacitating him. 
Link and Servus battle. After successfully weakening Servus, as he cannot truly be banished being bound to the power of Aemulor, he vanishes. Link talks to the injured solder, learning that he is a descendent of one of the
miners that were present on the islands centuries ago, and he only went on the expedition with the scholar because he felt it was the best opportunity to get out of Hyrule and possibly find Vita.

   It is heard amonst the guards in the Necromancer's castle that Link defeated an ancient Undead Legion Colonel. The guards know little of the Undead Legion of Aemulor, as the Necromancer has kept much of the original history
locked up in his study. They express minor concern that Link is already gaining a lot of power, and that the Necromancer should be informed. Later, Link finds a remote house near the mines occupied by the family of the Father 
and Son as well as the soldier. The Son found the soldier wandering out of the mine injured, and took him back to their house for rest. Link learns that the family living in the house are also decended from one of the miners that 
mined during the Calamity of Vita, and after finding out that the soldier is also a descendent, agreed to let him rest in their house, and trade tales of their lineage. The soldier informs Link that since Link helped him battle Servus,
he would aid Link on his quest as needed once he recovers. The soldier also tells Link that he was stationed at the guard tower outside of Viridi village, and was told to attack the village. He, not sypathetic to the Necromancer, gives 
Link a key into the tower and tells him he should stop their plans before they wipe out the village. Wiping out the village would give the Necromancer a significant advantage, as he knows any Hyrulian aid would come from the east.

<Mini Dungeon 2: Seized Guardtower>
~Major of the Tower ---Asseclan---~
   
   Along the way up the tower, Link encounters a soldier locked up in the barracks. He tells Link that he does not sypathise with the Necromancer. Link, unlocking the door, set him free where he flees to Viridi village to rest and hide. The needy
(You find him with the Hylian guard in the shop). Eventually he reaches the summit where the leader of the tower resides. Asseclan is a Major of the Necromancer, a soldier that was given additional privilege by the Necromancer, learning 
combat from a Legionnaire. Upon defeating the elite guard, Link finds a signet with the Hylian symbol on it, which belonged to the soldier locked up in the tower. The elite guard's intention was to use the signet to infiltrate the non 
corrupt soldiers' hideouts with surprise attacks. It is a symbol of opposition to the Necromancer, proving allegiance to Hyrule and not the Necromancer. Through adventuring Link finds a hidden tunnel near the center of the northeastern 
plains that takes him to a ruined house in the desert storm plagued village of Auri. The tunnel was dug by a crazed cultist to give easier access to the Shrine of Aemulor (similar to cultists trying to resurrect Dracula in Castlevania)
   Link finds Auri is mostly locked off, given the unending storm's rage. He does however find some residents open to letting him inside. One resident being the mayor of the village, concerned for his village, pleads with Link to help.
He suspects what could be the cause of the storms could be from a curse he read about in books from Auri Library, a library containing most of Vita's remaining written history. The curse being that there is evil in the ruins the well 
was built to cover and attempting to enter them could reawaken an evil that would engulf their village in an unending storm, and he wants Link to go down there and vanquish the evil. 
   Back during the age of Aemulor's reign, he had an outpost in modern day Auri village, and used it as a watch tower to keep an eye on the border between the northern and southern regions of the island. During the Calamity of Vita, 
the tower was destroyed, and layed in ruin as most of the soldiers, including another one of his Colonels, was buried in sand. As the ages passed, Auri was constructed, and a well was placed intentionally over the buried ruins in an 
attempt to prevent anyone from reentering the ruins. 

   The mayor speaks of a resident in Auri that had knowledge on the curse and how to enter the well. The resident was odd to say the least, spent very little time in the village, always in his house and muttering frantically to himself. 
One day this resident gave the mayor a key to his house, and told him to save it for an adventurer. This resident is a member of the Cult of Egentem, led by a crazed mage. The reason this resident was rarely seen by those in his village 
was because he often took his secret tunnel to the plains to get to the Shrine of Egentem to hear the word of the mage.
   The shrine was originally called the Shrine of Aemulor, the place of worship for the original Necromancer Aemulor that orchestrated the Calamity of Vita. As the ages proceeded the shrine became overgrown with vegetation, and to the current
inhabitants of the island it is just known as a place of darkness, presumed to be a remnant from the legend of the Calamity. It wasn't until Egentem the Reborn claimed it after his transformation and used it's dark presense as his stronghold and 
place to spread his knowledge to the cult he founded.
   The mayor gives Link the key to the resident's house. Link eventually finds the resident, dead. Turns out he died in his secret tunnel to Dodongos, and was revived from the Necromancer. He gives Link little information about himself, extatic 
that he is dead as that makes him a chosen follower of "Egentem the Reborn", and gives Link his Ocarina, as it is needed to enter the Shrine of Egentem, and he does not need to ocarina to enter given he is undead. Those who are living can only
enter the shrine using the tune. On Link's way to the Shrine of Egentem, he finds the small village of Silva guarded by non corrupt hylian soldiers which allows him into the village, given he has the signet of allegiance. Link learns that the 
village is near the front lines of where the Necromancer's forces come from down south, and express concern for the village. The guards there express their direness towards the Necromancer forces coming very close to the village, and ask Link 
to end the Necromancer. Link finds himself at the Shrine of Egentem, where he meets a living cultist frantically wanting to get into the shrine and does not have anyway to play the tune. Link plays the tune and enters the shrine with the cultist.

<<Level 3: Shrine of Aemulor>>
~The Reborn Chosen ---Egentem---~

   Eventually Link encounters the crazed mage Egentem and defeats him. This mage is a man convinsed that he is the ancient evil from the Legend of the Calamity of Vita reborn, and the Necromancer is a deciever. The leader of this cult is Egentem. 
He is seen as a normal man in full body robes, but underneath he is actually undead, and the reason for his robes is that he cannot be in sunlight. He is the product of some of the Necromancer's early experimentation with the triforce. He was a 
normal man captured, killed, and brought back with the triforce, but remembers the experience as having a near death experience where an ancient evil saved him from eternal torment and believes he is the chosen one. He is known throughout the cult 
that he is undead, and the only reason he could be living is through the power of the ancient evil. He is the only one in the cult to have any power, which is a very weak ability to revive only small creatures.
   Upon leaving the Shrine, a guard is standing outside of the shrine and speaks to Link urgently saying he found out where zelda is, and she was captured by the Necromancer's forces, held in a secret dungeon in the guardtower outside Viridi.
Link asks to see his signet of allegiance but the guard insists the situation is too dire for such trinkets. Upon getting to the tower and into the secret dungeon, Link is ambushed by a bunch of the Necromancer's forces, including the soldier that 
led him there. Their intention was not to kill Link, but rather knock him out, and just before blacking out the Necromancer can be seen entering. 
   Link wakes up before the Necromancer in his castle. The Necromancer knows link, given they had seen eachother in Hyrule. With this familiarity, the Necromancer offers link the chance to join his ranks being how strong he is, he could place really
high. The Necromancer almost certainly knows Link will turn down the offer, but thought perhaps he could suade Link. Unsurprisingly Link turns down the offer, the Necromancer chuckles, knowing full well Link would be ignorant enough to deny him.
The Necromancer describes how the power potential he has outweighs Ganon's tenfold, and that there is no way Link could stop him and how what he controls is nothing like Link has ever seen. Still Link refuses, and the Necromancer decides to hold Link
in his dungeon. Unfortunately for the Necromancer his plans happened out of order. His plan was to capture Zelda and use her to convinse Link to join his cause, but his forces have still yet to find Zelda. The Necromancer would like to still leverage
the might of Link, but worries that if he doesnt kill him then there is a good change he could escape.
   Eventually, while Link is still locked up in the dungeons, the Necromancer's Right Hand visits and speaks to Link. He explains who he is and his concerns for the Scholar, he wants to help Link escape but cannot be seen helping. He throws Link the
key to his cell and advises Link take the sewers to escape. The sewers are not typically traveled but Right Hand has used it a lot to leave the Castle unnoticed, since he leaves occassionally to help various Hylian soldiers by giving them insight to
the Necromancer's plans. He does warn Link that there are a lot of undead under the castle and it would not be easy for him to escape unnoticed, especially for a larger monster that the Necromancer has revived to guard the sewers. Right Hand never
struggled to pass given his high rank, but Link would stand out. He recommends Link get to a nearby village of <VILLAGE NAME> since there is an underground resistance where strong Hylian soldiers are brewing a large army of able villagers. There he
will find Zelda.

<Mini Dungeon 3: Domumbris Sewers (home of darkness - domum tenebris (Domumbris))>
~Undead Guard Dog ---IDK---~

   Link encounters a lot of undead animals in the sewers and eventually comes across <IDK>. IDK is considered the Necromancer's Pet as it was the first living thing that he practiced his powers on. Link escapes the sewers and makes his way to 
<VILLAGE NAME> where he finds the underground resistance and finds Zelda.
