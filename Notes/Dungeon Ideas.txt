a dungeon where you raise and lower lava as opposed to water, and once lowered the lava could have
eaten away at stuff that was weak before and now can be accessed. To deal with people being able to do things they missed just make a trigger that they can only hit once they have everything creating a "point of safe no return"

a dungeon where you dive through caverns and perhaps items that can be used during that like in OOT

Have a tunnel leading to the hellish final dungeon, and have it play "The Dream of Jacob" or "Ne Natura Soronis No.1"

Have a dungeon that is full of poison or something toxic, could say that it was a building or something that had become corrupted by some toxin found in the ground or that it was a factory where everyone inside died (and are now enemies because ya know, the necromancer) and there is a lot of toxic stuffs
