~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Opening Story ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<<<Intro Movie>>>
1   - All who live know of the three goddessess; Din, Farore, and Nayru. However, there is another whose name fell out of history.
2   - She is the goddess Haeren, governing life, death, and rebirth. Where Hylia passed the golden triforces to the Hylian Royal family...

3   - She, for some unknown reason, hid it on a remote island in a Temple of Haeren. The world soon forgot the existance of this estranged fourth triforce.
4   - Until...

5   - An expedition led by a Hylian Scholar found the remote island. In time, he discovered the secluded temple, acquiring a dark, forgotton triforce.

6   - In his research, he became obsessed with the power the triforce granted. Eventually claiming dominion over the nearby island of Vita
7   - With this dark terrible power, the scholar became a twisted shadow of the man he once was, and began to test his newely acquired powers.

8   - He used the life manipulating abilities of the triforce to abuse the living and dead, obtaining the name Necromancer by the inhabitants.

9   - Upon discovering his potential, the terror caused by his terrible necromancy concerned the Hylian Government.

10  - As a result Link and Zelda were sent with their newly acquired power, having defeated Ganon, to put and end to the Necromancer.

11  - And so, Link and Zelda set sail for the island now know as Interitus.
<<<>>>

<Link has typical end game gear, hearts, and magic and is on a ship with various guards giving him info about Interitus. Zelda also reassures Link>

<After some time the ship is attacked by the Leviathan>

400 - Terror of the Seas ---Leviathan---

<Two outcomes of the battle>
- Link wins, 
  19 - Impressive. The Necromancer was right, you are formidable. However, defeating me means nothing!
     - {{{Link Obtains the Leviathan Scale}}}
- Link loses,
  23 - Pity, The Necromancer made you out as a significant threat. Perhaps his plans will fail afterall.
<Branching of paths end>

24  - If you think you will be able to stop the Necromancer you will be sorely mistaken, you have no idea the magnitude of his power!
<He rises readying a massive wave>
25  - It matters not, I'm afraid you will not be making it to Interitus. It is time that the seas claim the Great Savior of Hyrule!

<Screen goes black, Link hears a voice calling out to him>

26 - Link.
27 - Wake up, Link.
28 - Link you must wake up!

<Link finds himself on a mysterious, inundated island>

29 - Thank goodness you are alright. After the Leviathan destroyed your ship I was not sure if you would awaken.
30 - You may be wondering where you are. You are on the island that once hosted my triforce, until that ignorant Scholar stole it!
31 - There was a reason my trifore was locked away on this forbidden island. But now that it is in the hands of humans...
32 - To make matters worse it is back on that accursed island, the whole world is now in grave danger once again.
33 - Link, I know your history, your pure heart. Only you can can restore the light within my triforce.
34 - Please, go to my temple, purge the darkness that has shrouded it for ages!
35 - I can feel my power waning... the darkness is... too much... Please Link...

   <Upon defeating Shambles in the triforce room Haeren speaks>
   43 - You have done it link! I can already feel the darkness receeding from my temple and my power returning!
   44 - As thanks, here is a Raft, may it provide passage to the island of Interitus to the West!
   45 - I wish you all the luck of the world, Link. There is a long and forgotton darkness in Interitus that the Scholar has likely awakened.
   46 - You must tread lightly, hopefully he hasn't escelated things beyond repair, and acquiring my Triforce won't prove too much for you.
   47 - We will speak again, Link!

<Link encounters the Leviathan on his way to Interitus>

<Two Dialog Paths based on earlier fight>
- Link wins,
   49 - You survived!?! I suppose I should expect no less from one who was able to best me. Now I understand your ability to banish ganon!
   50 - I have some respect for you Hero, so I suppose I will inform you that you are playing into the Necromancer's hands by going after him.
   51 - He is unlike any foe you may have faced in the past, he knows you and your history. He is ready for you! 
   52 - Enough of this. At least you will die knowing you never stood a chance, and the power of the Golden Triforces will be put to good use!
- Link loses,
   53 - You survived!?! I suppose I should expect no less from one who was able to banish ganon!
   54 - Sadly that little accomplishment will go unrewarded, you have nought but a plank of wood keeping you from your murky grave!
<Branching of paths end>

<link is hit by the Leviathan's second wave, the screen goes dark, and a voice is heard, Haeren Speaks>
194 - No Link! Do not succumb to the Leviathan's wrath. I have just enough strength to guide you to Interitus. 
195 - Know this, Link. You will not be alone. There are many that will fight with you!
196 - Farewell, Hero!

<<<Delayed intro movie showcasing various screens from the Island of Interitus>>>

<Player is given the option to play Normal or Paladin Mode. Paladin Mode will be unlocked upon beating the game (and 100%ing it)

<Link wakes up in a beach side shack where an old man resides, and speaks to you>
56 - Oh! You are awake! I found you washed ashore, barely alive. But I could swear you had a guardian angel keeping you from death.
57 - It is most unfortunate you find yourself here at this time, lad. There has been a terrible unrest on Vita lately.
58 - Well fortunately enough you do find yourself in a bit of luck, A number of your belongings washed ashore and I was able to collect them for you!
59 - Althought, unsurprisingly your raft was destroyed, not like you would want to head back out to sea with the way the seas are nowadays.
60 - I also must confess, I know who you are, Link, the Hero of Hyrule. We on Vita know of your successes over in Hyrule.
61 - Which means your being here must mean you are tasked with ending the Tyranny of the Necromancer.
62 - This will not be an easy task, but at the very least I have heard some rumors of the Necromancer's plans.
63 - Supposedly he split the dark Triforce into 4 shards, and has spread them about the island, under the protection of his most elite soldiers.
64 - I am sorry to say I do not know of the whereabouts of any of the shards, but I have seen an unnatural sickness fall upon the forest to the northeast.
65- Something like that has to be caused by one of the Necromancer's servants.
66 - Also it would be wise for you to speak to the inhabitants of the island, they will be able to assist you in your quest.
67 - Oh, and one last thing before you depart. Where my fighting days are over, I do believe there is something I can do to assist you.
68 - I can bestow upon you the ability to make the outlook on things better for you if things are not looking good.
69 - If you ever feel overwhelmed, stand across the fire and I will help ease your mind (or make things harder if you want a a challenge).
70 - Before you leave, you should probably let me take a look at you, to make sure you do not go out into the island in an improper state.
71 - Now, stand across the fire for us to begin...

<Link goes through Level 1 and in the boss room he finds the Necromancer>

"Ah, you have arrived Link. It seems my Leviathan was unable to claim you, no surprise given your reputation. The princess? 
My soldiers found her washed up on shore after your unfortunate accident. Do not worry, I have already stripped her of her 
Triforce of Wisdom and put her somewhere where she will be safe. Oh, I also possess the Triforce of Power, it was recovered 
from the wreckage of your ship. I do not expect you to give your Triforce of Courage freely, so I shall pry it from your corpse, 
which I will then use as as one of my most prized thralls!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Link fights the Necromancer which obviously is an unwinnable fight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"I hope you did not expect to win this fight, that wooden equpiment doesn't quite cut it does it? It matters not, I shall take your Triforce."

<The Necromancer takes the Triforce from Link>

"Hu, I did not think I could posses the feeling known as pity. Seeing you lay there all pathetic, almost a shame to destroy you. How about this, I will give my Leviathan another chance. I shall throw you to the sea and let him claim you, have fun!"

<The Necromancer throw Link back into the water, at the mercy of the Leviathan. But almost immidiately after, a small canoe piloted by an old man picks him up. He takes Link to his shake down the coast>

<Link wakes up>

"I see you are awake, I feared that you were lost. I know who you are Link, you are the hero that saved Hyrule numerous times. I see the Necromancer extracted the Triforce of Courage from you, that is unfortunate. I have heard word that he already posses 3 of the 4 triforce, all he needs to do is find Zelda and he will wreck havoc on entire world. Link, you must find Zelda, and collect all 4 Triforce before he can. I hear he split each Triforce into 3 fragments to prevent you from obtaining them. I managed to find the equipment you lost after your duel with the Necromancer, they are in the chest behind me. Good luck Link!"

<Link enters the boss room and encounters the Necromancer>

"My my my, Link. How far you have come. And look at that! You have nearly fully assembled all of the Triforces. Unfortuantely, your journey comes to an end. You are no longer necessary to my plans. Also, I have found an old buddy of yours that would like to catchup with you. He was known to you as Ganon, but Ganon was but an insignificant, arrogant swine. All he wanted was the power of the Triforce to conquer the world. He was short sighted, he did not look past his puny ambitions. He did not think outside of the box. With the Triforce of Death, there is far more that can be done. Although, I am not so arrogant as to reveal my plans, that is such a stupid villan thing to do. But what I will tell you is that I have made Ganon what he could have been; an actual threat. Before, he could be slain by arrows fasioned out of a shiny metal, how pathetic. I have infused him with my necromancy power, Silver Arrows are useless against him, he is now PURE DARKNESS!! I suppose it will be nice for him to finally destroy the Savior of Hyrule and the bane of his banishment. GANON, ARISE!!!

<Ganon rising like how Nightmare from Fusion rose>

"GANON, DESTROY!!"

<You fight Undead Ganon and win obviously since you have the Light Arrows, upon his final death>

"What?! How dare you find something here that can slay one of my greatest creations!! Oh the graification would have been sweet as well. No matter. Once insignificant always insignificant. I fear not your quest to obtain all of the Triforce, I suppose you do have some usefullness left in you."

<You proceed to the Triforce room to find the Triforce, upon grabbing it you are ambushed by cloaked figures>

<Screen goes black, the it is revealed you are in Zelda's Hideout>

"Link, are you alright? I hope they did not harm you as they got you out of <Level 11, use its name here>."

<Animation reveals that the Cloaked Zelda is Zelda>

"It is alright Link, I am fine. After we were attacked by the Leviathan I woke up in a dungeon and my Triforce was gone. But luckily the the good people of Interitus rescued me and I helped them construct a new hideout. Their original one was found by the Necromencer's forces. I also filled them in on everything going on and who we are. I see you have reclaimed all but 2 of the Triforce of Death;s fragments, the people here informed me about the Triforce of Death and how it has enabled the Necromancer to bring back the dead. They say the only way to stop him is to destroy the evil triforce! So Link, we must find the last fragments and..."

<Voice of that old man that saved you after Leviathan>

"No!  It cannot be destroyed. The Triforce of Death is not all it is. It was once the Triforce of Life before the corrupt heart of Naamen. Naamen is what he was once called before he became corrupted by the Triforce of Death. How do I know all of this? I came to this island during the expedition that was led by Naamen, I managed to stay out of his way as he made a plaything out of this land. But we never forgot what he did and what the Triforce of Life is. Link, to stop him you must cleanse the Triforce of Life by bringing it to the Shrine of Haeren. One problem is, I have no idea where it is. This land only has the shrines of the other three goddesses."

<Voice of Zelda>

"So we must find this Shrine of Haeren, I have no idea where that is as well, do you Link? Well I suppose it doesn't matter yet. We shall search for this shrine while you collect the rest of the fragments, good luck all of us!"

<You go to the Shrine of Nayru for Nayru's Love and Scholar's Mind>

<With Undead Ganon gone you can access Battle Arena 4 and Level 12>

<The Triforce of Wisdom has been fully assembled, Link goes to the Shrine of Nayru and eventually gains Nayru's Love as well as Scholar's Mind>

<You need all 3 goddess gems to gain access to Battle Arena 4, all 3 give the Hero's Sword>

<You head back to the hideout to tell them you have the fragments and you know that the shrine of Haeren is on the Island of Haeren and you know where the portal to get there is. But when you get to the hideout, it is destroyed, you explore the rubble, only to find a gaping hole in the back of it, you go in>

"Ahh Link. Wow, it took you only THAT much time to retrieve the last 2 fragments of the Triforce of Death eh? Well, you are indeed a freak of nature to be able to run through ALL of my minions and to do it so easily. As impressive as you are you are, your compulsiveness to go around collecting pieces of extremely power artifacts and bringing them to one place makes me question how smart you really are. You retrieved all of the fragments of Haeren's Triforce, just, for, me. Yea yea yea I know I sound like a generic arrogant villan who thinks he already won. But the thing is, I have. Oh yes it would be so simple to go to the Shrine of Haeren and cleanse this Triforce and have a happily ever after. But you see that wont happen."

<He proceeds to kill Zelda and the rest of the innocent civilians>

"Zelda is dead, that wreched old man is dead, all that you trusted is dead. It is only you, me, and my whole army of the undead!"

<You become surrounded as he makes all he killed including zelda, undead thralls>

"I honestly do not think you can squirm your way out of this. I will take your Triforce of Death fragments, those other 3 Triforce are useless, all I want are those fragments Link, hand them over."

<You do>

"Finally you come to your senses Link and actually do something the easy way, although I suppose in the past you always did things the hard way and succeeded so I suppose I should be flattered you felt helpless to me. Goodbye Link, I am off to the Shrine of Haeren, and please do keep your undead princess and friends company, they have missed you spending those brief moments in Hell."

<He warps out, and you are forced to flee, fighting your way out but you cant kill any of them, make them swarm you and you walk slowly out of the cave and eventually escape>

<Once out, you b-line to the portal to the Island of Haeren>

<Once on the island you make your way to the shrine and attempt to stop the Necromancer>

"Honestly I am not surprised by you anymore Link. Although I hope you enjoyed slashing you sword at your dear friends, I am sure they appreciated that. You know how when the Goddesses left this world they imbued the Triforces with their power, leaving the Triforces as their..."

<Link throws his boomerang at him in rage, missing him>

"HO ho ho temper temper. As I was saying, they left their Triforces as their only presence on this world, and went to Heavens. Have you ever wondered where EXACTLY they went? They went to the core of creation, the infinite void of incomprehensible power, the power that created them! I shall join them. By purging this Triforce of any life it may yet possess, I shall have more of an influence on it than that of its creator! I shall become a literal GOD, and RISE to the VOID OF CREATION!! I SHALL BE KNOWN AS, APOPHIS, GOD OF DEATH!!! Now, I assume you wish to have one of your classic 'fight before the bad guy can do his thing' fight. I suppose it would be fitting that the last thing I do on this plane of existance is destroy the last remaining hope this world has."

<This is the Final Boss, if you die here, just for the first death, there will be a cutscene of him doing what he said just before the game over, subsequent deaths will not show this cutscene>

<You beat him and the game ends with the credits, Minidungeon 8 is unlocked after and the Main Dungeon of the post game begins>

"How.....how could you defeat me? This isn't possible! I knew you were powerful, but you are still just a child!"

<Your 3 Triforces glow brightly>

"Those wretched Goddesses! This will not last 'hero'! If you cleanse that triforce you have no idea what you will release! This island has a history, a very dark history, and by cleansing the Triforce of Death you will release them. HAHAHAH....uhng......AAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!"

<He explodes and dies>

<There is a cutscene of you taking the Triforce of Death to the Shrine of Haeren and it gets cleansed. The island becomes cleansed of all that the Necromancer wroght>

<Upon cleansing the triforce Haeren speaks to Link>

"Link, you have cleansed my Triforce and have saved Vita. Vita? That is what this land was once known as, in some tongues it means Life. Ever since the Necromancer claimed the island it was referred to as Interitus, meaning Decay. With the Triforce of Life in hand you will be able to undo all of the damage done by the Triforce of Death."

<Link heads back to where Zelda and friends were killed, raises up the Triforce of Life and everyone gets better>

"Link? What happened Link? Have you destroyed the Necromancer? I no longer have this sense of dread. The Triforce! It is no longer dark! You cleansed it! We must cleanse this island Link! Then, we may return home!

<The credits roll and the scenes playing behind the credits is Link and Zelda cleansing the island with the Triforce of Life>

<The credits show them getting on a repaired ship and sailing home>

<The final scene in the credits is a scene of that tomb that Zelda was being held in, there is a door in that tomb that lights up, screen goes black>

"You have completed The Terror of Necromancy, Sound Test is available and you may play it on Paladin Mode"

<returns you to the starting screen>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Post Game ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<So basically The Necromancer, after corrupting the Triforce, he encountered the Undead Legion and sealed them with the power of the Triforce of Death, since Link cleansed it the seal was broken. The Necromancer sealed them because even he feared them. You can find a book that the Necromancer wrote explaining this information>

<Post Game begins. You reload your game your game and it takes you to the starting screen>

<At this point you have the Triforce of Life, return to the Shrine of Haeren and obtain Haeren's Grace and Death's Touch>

<With all 4 completed Triforce return to the Holy Shrine that I made somewhere in the game, a door will have been opened>

<The door leads down a secret walkway, you come to a room with 6 Chests, each containing a Holy equipment piece>

<Upon opening each chest you are greeted by dialogue explaining it (adds drama and meaning)>

<At the top center of the room there is a tablet that reads...>

"The way of the Paladin is a riteous one. The War for Light is neverending, for the Undead Legion is everywhere, nearly impossible to completely vanquish. To ye who reads this tablet, if you be worthy, claim the Arms and Armor of the Paladin, and Keep the Undead Legion at bay."

<You open all of the chests, giving the Holy Sword, Holy Mail, Holy Boomerang, Holy Hammer, Holy Arrows, Holy Shield>

<The tomb that the Necromancer locked Zelda up in is the largest tomb in the graveyard, this is what opens up when the helmet and all 20 rings are palaced, it is the main dungeon of the post game>

<You head to the door in the Tomb where Zelda was held, if you fifill the requirements it will open when you enter that room>
